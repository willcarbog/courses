JONATHAN GRUBER: All right.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,760
Why don't we get started?

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,130
Today, we're going to continue
our discussion of producer

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,120
theory.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,400
Once again, to remember
to put this in context,

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,280
the first few lectures were
working consumer theory

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,380
to help us derive
a demand curve.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,880
Now we're working
on producer theory

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,550
to help us come up
with a supply curve.

13
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,740
We started last time
by talking about how

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,730
producers profit maximizes,
and the profit maximization

15
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,137
implies cost minimization.

16
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:40,720
Therefore, to maximize
profits, you're

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,450
going to want to produce
as efficiently as possible.

18
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,140
And basically, to
do that, we need

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,860
to understand how your
costs vary with your output.

20
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,080
If you're going to produce
at an efficient level,

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,350
you need to understand how what
your costs are going to vary

22
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,273
with your level of production.

23
00:00:58,273 --> 00:00:59,940
So essentially, our
goal of this lecture

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,470
is to develop a cost curve--

25
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,720
develop a curve which tells you
how the cost of your production

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,330
varies with how
much you produce.

27
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,640
And that's what we're
after in this lecture.

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,660
OK?

29
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,730
So we're going to start
with the short run

30
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,402
and then turn to the long run.

31
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:19,360
So start with developing
a short-run cost curve

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,300
and then turn to a long-run.

33
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,090
OK?

34
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,982
And to make this lecture sort
of mathematically coherent,

35
00:01:24,982 --> 00:01:26,440
throughout the
whole lecture, we'll

36
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,680
work with our favorite
functional form--

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,960
a production form
of the function q

38
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,660
equals the square root
of L times K. Remember,

39
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,190
firms produce goods--

40
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,910
little q-- using two
inputs, labor and capital.

41
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,210
Labor is a variable input.

42
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,030
That means you can change it in
the short run and the long run.

43
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,750
Capital is a fixed input,
which means that you can only

44
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,670
change it in the long run.

45
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,690
OK?

46
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,170
So in the short run, we're going
to have two kinds of costs.

47
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,630
We're going to have
fixed costs, which

48
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,720
are going to come from a
fixed level of capital,

49
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,910
and we're going to
variable costs, which are

50
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,140
going to come from our labor.

51
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,540
So we're going to have two
kinds of costs: fixed costs--

52
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,620
they're fixed, because
in the short run,

53
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,570
you can't change the
level of capital--

54
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,950
and variable costs, which
are the costs of our labor.

55
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,110
And then we're going
to have total costs.

56
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,880
They're simply going to be
fixed costs plus variable costs.

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,400
OK?

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,540
So that's how we
think about costs.

59
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,410
The costs of a firm's
production in the short run

60
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,600
is the sum of
their fixed costs--

61
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,190
i.e., their capital costs--

62
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,600
and the variable costs--

63
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,820
i.e., their labor costs.

64
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,450
Now, we're going to show you
how you can turn a production

65
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,780
function into a cost function.

66
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,820
And to do so, you simply
need to recognize that cost--

67
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,450
the costs of firms' production--

68
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,530
are simply the amount
of capital that

69
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,680
uses k bar times the price
of that capital, which we'll

70
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,900
call r, plus the amount
of labor it uses,

71
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,980
times the price of that labor,
which we'll call W, the wage.

72
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,680
OK?

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,180
This is the easy part.

74
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,680
Think of the amount
of hours of work

75
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,590
you use times the wage per
hour, or the amount of workers

76
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,360
times the salary per year.

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,270
In any case, this is
easier to understand.

78
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,170
Every additional
unit of labor comes

79
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,800
with a cost that is the
wage of that unit of labor.

80
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,130
Think about an hourly model.

81
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,650
Every hour you work at
your convenience store,

82
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,960
they have to pay you the
minimum wage for that hour.

83
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,460
OK?

84
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,700
That's the cost of
that hour of labor.

85
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,300
Capital is harder.

86
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,370
We call r the rental rate.

87
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,070
And the reason is because we
don't think of buying capital.

88
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,840
Don't think of buying a machine.

89
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,850
Think of renting a machine.

90
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,750
The reason we do that is to
make the periodicity work.

91
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,330
OK?

92
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,670
You don't buy a
worker, thank god.

93
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,110
You rent that worker.

94
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,200
And you rent that
worker at a price, w.

95
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
So when the firm uses
your time, they're

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,900
renting your time an hour
at a time at a price, w.

97
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,750
When we get machines,
think of a firm

98
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,420
as renting machines for a price,
r per machine per time period.

99
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,140
OK?

100
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,177
So I understand firms
usually don't do this.

101
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:11,260
They usually buy machines.

102
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,060
And we'll come
back to even if you

103
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,940
buy a machine how it
effectively is like renting it,

104
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,130
but for ease of
thinking about this,

105
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,350
you want to think about
flows, not stocks.

106
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,900
Think about the firm's
decision as renting a worker

107
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,260
at the price, w, or renting
a machine at the price, r.

108
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,907
Yeah.

109
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:28,532
AUDIENCE: Kind of
like also we consider

110
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:30,332
the gas and electricity
a machine can

111
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:31,330
use in productivity?

112
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,110
JONATHAN GRUBER: All
that would be in there,

113
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,277
and we'll come back to that.

114
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:33,850
That's right.

115
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,510
This is sort of the per period
cost of using a machine.

116
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,010
This is the per period cost of
using a worker, is the wage.

117
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,510
This is the per
period cost of using

118
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,300
a machine, which will include
all the costs of running

119
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,660
the machine as well as the costs
of renting the machine itself.

120
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,177
OK?

121
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:54,260
So later, we'll talk about
how to own the machine.

122
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,000
And we'll come back to the
fact that you can actually

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,585
use r as a representation.

124
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:57,245
It's not bad.

125
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:59,120
But for now, just think
of renting a machine.

126
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,610
Or if it's a building,
think of this as the rent

127
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,470
you pay on that building, OK?

128
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,750
Not the cost to
build the building.

129
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,800
Now, armed with our
production function--

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,812
and let's also say,
to make life easy--

131
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:16,020
I did this wrong on my notes.

132
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,140
So I hope the other
teachers figured it out.

133
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,060
To make life easy, let's
say that the rental rate, r,

134
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,260
we're going to say is
$10, and the wage rate, w,

135
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,015
is going to be $5.

136
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,350
Now, armed with a
production function,

137
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,720
if you simply have the
production function

138
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,020
and these two prices, you
can derive the short-run cost

139
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,760
function.

140
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,030
How do you do that?

141
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,370
Well, just look at the math.

142
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,060
We know that q equals
square root of L times

143
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,330
k bar in the short-run.

144
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,550
L times k bar.

145
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,660
OK?

146
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,650
So inverting that simply
means that L equals q

147
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,500
squared over k bar.

148
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,250
L equals q squared over k bar.

149
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,760
OK?

150
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:24,260
And that means that cost
can be written as 10 k bar--

151
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,420
the price the rental
rate is 10, we

152
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,000
have k bar amount of capital--

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,460
plus 5q squared over k bar.

154
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,980
That's our cost function.

155
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,720
I just plugged in for L and
multiplied by the wage rate, w,

156
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,470
which is 5.

157
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,340
OK?

158
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,300
So for example, for a fixed
level of capital, this is cost.

159
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,070
So for example, let's imagine
our short-run level of capital

160
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,935
is 1.

161
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:54,310
Let's imagine there's 1 unit
of capital in the short run,

162
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,320
just to make the math easy.

163
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:05,090
Then that simply says that
cost equals 10 plus 5q squared.

164
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,570
And that's our cost function.

165
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,620
10 plus 5q squared.

166
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,550
We've just derived the
short-run cost function.

167
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,400
10 is the fixed cost component.

168
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,470
That doesn't vary with
the amount you produce.

169
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,980
So there's no q part of this.

170
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,740
5q squared is the
variable component.

171
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,440
That varies with how
much you produce.

172
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,630
So the cost function
is a fixed part,

173
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,670
which comes from that one
fixed unit of capital,

174
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,120
and the varying part,
which comes from the fact

175
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,370
that the amount of q drives
the amount of labor we need.

176
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,240
OK?

177
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,270
Questions about that math?

178
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,060
All right.

179
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,965
Now, armed with
this cost function,

180
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,670
let's write that
down again here.

181
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:53,453
So C equals 10 plus 5q squared.

182
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:55,370
That's going to be our
short-run cost function

183
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,030
we're going to work with.

184
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,550
And remember, that short-run
cost function came directly

185
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,020
from that production function.

186
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,340
To derive this
equation, all I needed

187
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,550
was that production function
and those two prices,

188
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,930
and I derived it.

189
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,680
OK.

190
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,530
Armed with that,
we can define some

191
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,720
of the key concepts
that will drive

192
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,580
our entire analysis of firms.

193
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,590
And the single most
important concept

194
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,320
is marginal cost, which
is what it sounds like--

195
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,100
the derivative costs
with respect to quantity.

196
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,950
OK?

197
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,540
So in this, the marginal
cost is delta c delta q.

198
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,860
OK?

199
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,049
That's marginal cost.

200
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:35,909
OK.

201
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:41,425
We'll also care about average
cost, which is just c over q.

202
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:42,800
It's very important
in this class

203
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,950
to keep our marginals
separate from our averages.

204
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,950
The average is simply over the
entire range of production.

205
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,410
What is the average cost
to produce each unit?

206
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,740
The marginal is what's the cost
of producing the next unit?

207
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,020
And since production
functions are nonlinear,

208
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,580
those will not be
the same, generally.

209
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,080
OK.

210
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,600
Average will not equal
marginal in general,

211
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,960
because a nonlinear function
delta c delta q is not

212
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,560
the same as c/q.

213
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,930
OK?

214
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,960
So we can actually graph
these in figure 6-1.

215
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,430
Figure 6-1 shows the cost
curves for this cost function

216
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,370
I just wrote down, which comes
from that production function.

217
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,510
OK?

218
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,620
So you can see that the
marginal cost, as I said,

219
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,045
is delta c delta q.

220
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:28,980
Well, that's 10q.

221
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,480
So the marginal cost, the cost
of producing the next unit,

222
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,550
rises with the number of units.

223
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,300
Which makes sense.

224
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,123
The cost has a q
squared term in it,

225
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:40,540
So obviously, the
marginal cost is

226
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,450
going to have a q term in it.

227
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,620
So basically, the
more you produce,

228
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,560
the higher your marginal cost.

229
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,935
The more unit you need to
produce, the more the little q,

230
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:50,800
the higher your marginal cost.

231
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,150
Average cost is this sort
of funky shaped thing,

232
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,560
where it's--

233
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,350
which is 10 over q plus 5q--

234
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,020
I just divided this by q--

235
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,120
where it's first declining
and then increasing.

236
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,440
Why is that?

237
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,340
Why is average cost first
declining and then increasing?

238
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,900
We've seen what--
just intuitively?

239
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,960
Why is that?

240
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,880
Why in general in the short
run would we expect that?

241
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,886
Average cost first to
fall and then increase.

242
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:21,640
Anyone have ideas?

243
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,347
Yeah.

244
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:25,245
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
start up [INAUDIBLE]..

245
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:27,370
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well--
no, but it's falling first.

246
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,770
So why is it falling first?

247
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,752
It's about that-- yeah.

248
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:32,544
AUDIENCE: They have a
really high average--

249
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:35,510
or first fixed cost is not
[INAUDIBLE] the more you make,

250
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,490
the lower that is.

251
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,448
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

252
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:39,406
The first units are paying
off your fixed costs

253
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:40,323
if you think about it.

254
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:41,990
Well, the first unit
you sell, basically

255
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,450
you start with this
huge fixed cost.

256
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,105
So actually, by
selling two units, yes,

257
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,730
you get the variable
cost, second unit,

258
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,370
but you get to pay off the
fixed cost, the first unit.

259
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,660
So look at here on this graph.

260
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,620
We show average fixed costs
and average variable costs

261
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,410
Average fixed costs are 10/q.

262
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,950
If you only produce one unit,
your average fixed cost is $10.

263
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,300
To produce two units it's $5.

264
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,130
With every unit you produce,
your average fixed cost

265
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:06,630
is falling.

266
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,230
You're paying off
that fixed cost.

267
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,850
Average variable cost rises.

268
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,650
Every unit you
produce, you're getting

269
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,720
more and more variable cost.

270
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,180
You put those together,
and you get a function that

271
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,430
first declines and then rises.

272
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,893
You first pay off
your fixed costs,

273
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:24,310
so your average
costs are falling,

274
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,080
then your marginal cost--
then you start to rise,

275
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,038
because you've got marginal
costs that increase

276
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:29,470
with quantity produced.

277
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,220
And critically,
the marginal cost

278
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,920
intersects the
average cost curve

279
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,290
at the minimum of average cost.

280
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,810
And that's just mathematical.

281
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,590
If you have any function,
and you take the average,

282
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,850
then the minimum is going to be
a derivative that basically--

283
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:55,070
before you get to here, 1.5
units, before 1.5 units,

284
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,828
average cost is
above marginal cost,

285
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:00,620
because you're paying
off your fixed costs.

286
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,500
Once you get beyond
1.5 units, average cost

287
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,220
is below marginal cost.

288
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,868
So average cost
hits marginal cost

289
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:08,160
at the minimum of average cost.

290
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,020
Yeah.

291
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,360
AUDIENCE: In a
relatively large company,

292
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,685
eventually doesn't really
worry about their fixed cost,

293
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:16,560
because if they're having
a lot more workers,

294
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,160
their entire cost is going
to be considered basically--

295
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,430
JONATHAN GRUBER:
In the short run.

296
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,930
It depends on this function.

297
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,750
You said large, but large
can be defined in two ways.

298
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,740
But absolute true.

299
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,770
Certainly, if we take
this very function,

300
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:35,330
for large enough q's average
fixed cost asymptotes to 0.

301
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,180
10 over infinity is 0.

302
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,790
So for large enough q's, the
average fixed cost goes away--

303
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,490
in the short run.

304
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,870
Remember, we're in the short
run with these fixed costs.

305
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,530
OK.

306
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,727
Now, so other questions.

307
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,310
Good question.

308
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,320
Other questions about that?

309
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,440
So that's our basic
intuition, the short run--

310
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,720
is that at first our
costs are super high,

311
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,080
because you've got to pay--
you had to build the plant.

312
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,618
But then over time,
that plant cost falls,

313
00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:04,160
and then your only
costs is basically

314
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,660
the fact you've got to
hire more workers if you

315
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,535
want to produce more.

316
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,730
Now, what we want to notice
is that in the short run

317
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,780
there is a really
close relationship--

318
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,290
one was the key relationship
between marginal cost

319
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,365
and the marginal
product of labor,

320
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:24,490
which we defined last time.

321
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,370
Remember, the marginal
product of labor was dq dL.

322
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,895
How much-- remember
digging a hole

323
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,270
and diminishing
marginal product?

324
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,820
That each additional worker,
for a fixed level of capital,

325
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,800
is less and less
productive, right?

326
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,220
We talked about that last time.

327
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,150
Well, the marginal cost of
production is, as I said,

328
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,170
equal to delta c over delta q.

329
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,210
OK?

330
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,960
Well, we know from last
time that delta q over delta

331
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,600
L we defined as the
marginal product of labor.

332
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:04,190
Plugging those and-- so we know
marginal cost is delta c delta

333
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,140
q.

334
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,010
And we can write this-- if you
take the derivative of the cost

335
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,230
function, so our general
cost function up there--

336
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,540
see the cost function
at the top there?

337
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,980
Take the derivative of that with
respect to the amount of labor.

338
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,170
Well, the first term drops
out, because it's fixed.

339
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:30,966
So you can rewrite delta c delta
q as w times delta L delta q--

340
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:33,730
w times delta L delta q.

341
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,680
Right.

342
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,200
I just rewrote delta
c-- q delta w-- god.

343
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,700
Brutal.

344
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,650
Sorry, guys.

345
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:45,640
w times delta L over delta q.

346
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,140
OK.

347
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,990
A little bit better.

348
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,490
OK.

349
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,948
I read that, because I just
took the derivative of the cost

350
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:51,255
function.

351
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,130
First term drops out,
we take the derivative.

352
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,080
Second term, I just took
the derivative here,

353
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,050
or the discrete derivative, and
I just said, delta c delta q

354
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,323
is w times delta L delta q.

355
00:15:00,323 --> 00:15:01,740
Well, we know the
marginal product

356
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,890
is delta q over
delta L. So we can

357
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:12,090
rewrite marginal cost as w over
the marginal product of labor.

358
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,690
The marginal cost
is equal to w over

359
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,610
the marginal product of labor.

360
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,400
And that makes sense.

361
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,160
The marginal cost
of the next unit

362
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,310
will be higher the
higher the wage

363
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,820
and lower the more
productive the worker.

364
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,210
Making another unit with a super
productive worker is cheap.

365
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,335
Making another unit with
a very unproductive worker

366
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,320
is expensive.

367
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,830
So essentially, the more you
pay them for each hour of work,

368
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,870
the higher your marginal cost.

369
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,510
But the less they get
done each hour of work,

370
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,850
the higher your marginal cost.

371
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,060
So that's why, roughly
speaking, firms

372
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,540
might want to pay a lot to
people who are high skilled.

373
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,407
So you might say, gee, why are
they paying my friend twice

374
00:15:58,407 --> 00:15:58,990
what I'm paid?

375
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,750
Well, maybe your friend's
twice as productive as you.

376
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,310
That would make-- or two and
a half times as productive

377
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:03,810
as you.

378
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,110
And that would make sense.

379
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,183
So we can't just say
that it's a mistake

380
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:08,350
to pay someone higher wages.

381
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,975
We have to consider their wages
relative to how productive they

382
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:12,910
are.

383
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:18,110
And that's a key relationship
we'll come back to.

384
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,370
OK?

385
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,950
Question about that?

386
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,790
All right.

387
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,300
That's the short run.

388
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,860
Now let's go to
the long run, which

389
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,820
gets a little more interesting.

390
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,278
Actually, let's
write in that side.

391
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,700
I'll switch to this side today.

392
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,408
Switch things up.

393
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
This way, this side, I
block you less, probably.

394
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,280
So I should do this side.

395
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,850
OK.

396
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,020
Long run cost curves.

397
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,010
OK.

398
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,150
Long run cost.

399
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:50,720
Now, here what gets interesting,
is now K is no longer fixed.

400
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,620
Now we get to choose
our input mix.

401
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,700
And now our goal is going to
be, how do we choose our input

402
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,410
mix to minimize costs?

403
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,610
That's our goal here.

404
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,599
How we going to choose the
mix of workers and machines

405
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,290
to produce a given
quantity most efficiently?

406
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,220
Now, that optimal mix may
change with the quantity.

407
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,220
So we're going to start.

408
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,220
We're going to do
this in two steps.

409
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,060
First, we're going to say, for
a given quantity picked out

410
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,720
of a hat, what's the right
mix of labor and capital

411
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,480
that minimizes the cost of
producing that quantity, given

412
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,280
our production function?

413
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,140
Then we're going to
say, as the quantity

414
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,530
varies how does that change
the optimal mix of L and K?

415
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,190
And does it?

416
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,860
So two steps.

417
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,040
First say, for a
given quantity, what's

418
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,600
the right L and K
to minimize costs

419
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,830
of producing that quantity?

420
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,590
Then ask, well, as we vary
the quantity how does L--

421
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,900
how do L and K vary optimally?

422
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,420
OK.

423
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,850
So basically, we want to find
the economically efficient

424
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,720
combination of L and K
which is a combination that

425
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,470
produces goods at minimum cost.

426
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,343
And to do this, we are
going to write down--

427
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,010
to derive this we're
going to write down

428
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,610
what we call isocost curves.

429
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,170
Isocost curves.

430
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,360
Remember last time
we did isoquants,

431
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,760
Which felt a lot like
the difference curves?

432
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,840
Isocosts are going to feel a
lot like budget constraints.

433
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,560
Isocost curves are essentially
the firm's budget constraint.

434
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,120
They're essentially
mappings of the function

435
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,420
c equals wL plus rK--

436
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,400
essentially, mappings for
different amounts of K and L

437
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,520
of the function c
equals rK plus wL.

438
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,930
So if you look at figure 6-2,
here we see our isocost lines.

439
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,790
OK.

440
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,870
So let's talk about
this for a second.

441
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,960
So for example, take the
middle one, the $100 isocost.

442
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,470
This is saying, what
combinations of labor

443
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:54,000
and capital cost you $100?

444
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,220
Well, with a rental rate
of $10 and a wage of $5,

445
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,490
that means you can have
10 machines and no workers

446
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,473
or 20 workers and no machines,
or some combination in between.

447
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:08,890
This is just a
budget constraints.

448
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,682
It's just saying, given
the amount of money

449
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,168
you want to spend,
given your cost,

450
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:15,960
how many machines and
workers can you have?

451
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,127
The difference is,
we don't start--

452
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:19,710
I didn't start this
example by saying,

453
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,330
your parents give you x dollars.

454
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,628
That's why firm theory is
harder than consumer theory.

455
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:25,920
I pin down the consumer theory
problem much more easily

456
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,720
by saying, your parents
give you x dollars, which

457
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,012
told you which line to derive--

458
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:29,512
graph.

459
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:30,510
I don't have that here.

460
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,718
I haven't told you that here.

461
00:19:31,718 --> 00:19:33,990
So you have to graph a
series of isocost curves,

462
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,778
because you don't know what the
optimal cost is going to be.

463
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:38,070
That's to be pinned down later.

464
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,260
That's what makes
supply theory harder.

465
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,670
You have to draw the series.

466
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,250
So you draw these series
of isocost curves--

467
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,310
different combinations
that represent different

468
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,350
amounts, different
totals of cost.

469
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:54,010
And of course, the slope
of that isocost curve

470
00:19:54,010 --> 00:20:01,382
is delta K delta L,
or minus w over r.

471
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:02,090
That's the slope.

472
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:09,070
Or in this case, minus 0.5.

473
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,652
Now, those of you
thinking ahead--

474
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:12,610
I know you guys are very
insightful as a class,

475
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,440
I'm sure many of you
are thinking ahead--

476
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,200
might think, gee,
that slope might

477
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,480
change as the number of
workers and machines change.

478
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,092
Could you imagine the relative
price of capital labor changes

479
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:24,550
in different costs-- and it
might, and we'll put that aside

480
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,720
for now.

481
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,290
For now, assuming for every
relevant quantity these prices

482
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,500
$5 and $10 are fixed--

483
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,250
let's ignore where
those prices come from.

484
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,208
They're just given now.

485
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,153
We'll come back to that later.

486
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,570
Like I said, this course is
sort of like peeling an onion.

487
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,570
We raise things, then we come
back go to the next layer.

488
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,660
Where'd that come from?

489
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,633
Right now-- we'll tell you
where w and r come from.

490
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:46,550
Right now we're just
going to take them fixed.

491
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,380
And we'll assume they're
always $5 and $10,

492
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,900
regardless of the
amount produced.

493
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,020
OK.

494
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,312
Now, here's the question.

495
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:55,770
You're a firm that
wants to release

496
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,700
a certain amount of units.

497
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,350
You have a production
function and a cost function.

498
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:07,210
How do you graphically figure
out the right combination

499
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,190
of capital labor
to use to produce

500
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,100
a certain amount of units?

501
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,475
Yeah.

502
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:17,690
AUDIENCE: Could it be the
tension between the isoquant

503
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,960
and the isocost curves?

504
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,970
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's exactly right.

505
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,880
Just as I asked you, what is
the right combination of pizza

506
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,090
and cookies, and
you told me that it

507
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,580
was the tangency
of the indifference

508
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,810
curve and the budget constraint,
it's the exact same logic here.

509
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,000
The optimal mix of
capital and labor

510
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,770
comes from the tangency of
the isoquant with the isocost,

511
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,470
as we see in figure 6-3.

512
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,420
And ignore the, like--

513
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,545
somehow that curve is sort
of connected at the top.

514
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:49,003
It's sort of a
glitch a PowerPoint.

515
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:49,740
Just ignore that.

516
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,620
It's not actually like
a square or a trapezoid.

517
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,877
It's just a curve.

518
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:54,960
What would you call that--

519
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,127
the curve and the two sides.

520
00:21:56,127 --> 00:21:57,920
Is that a-- that's
not a trapezoid.

521
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,650
That's not-- it's not a polygon.

522
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,730
It's just a line.

523
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,080
All right.

524
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,360
So basically-- is
there a name for that?

525
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,350
A curve and two lines?

526
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,745
I don't think so.

527
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:08,870
It's just a polygon, right?

528
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,380
OK.

529
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,930
So it's not a polygon,
it's just a curve.

530
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,160
So the curve is the isoquant
for the square root of 12.5.

531
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,700
What do I mean by that?

532
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,730
I mean that is the combination
of capital and labor

533
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,230
that delivers square root
of 12.5 units of production.

534
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,070
So what that curve is
all possible combinations

535
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,310
of capital and
labor that deliver

536
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,158
square root of 12.5 units.

537
00:22:37,158 --> 00:22:39,700
Just like the indifference curve
is all possible combinations

538
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,980
of pizza and cookies that
leaves you equally happy,

539
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,355
this is all possible
combinations

540
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:45,523
of capital and
labor that leads you

541
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:46,690
to a given production level.

542
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,500
And as we said, the
further out the isoquant,

543
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,810
the more you can produce.

544
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,830
So you want to produce as much
as you can given the prices you

545
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,250
face in the market.

546
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,160
Well, those prices
you face in the market

547
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,780
are delivered by
the isocost curve.

548
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,080
So the tangency is the best--

549
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,450
is the cost minimizing point.

550
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,080
That's when you're producing
the most you can given the costs

551
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,575
you face in the market--

552
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:14,950
the most you can, given the
costs you face in the market.

553
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,090
And that tangency
condition-- once again,

554
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,550
considering our parallels
to consumer theory,

555
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,000
the tangency condition is going
to deliver that the marginal

556
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,130
product--

557
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,520
is going to deliver that the
marginal product of labor

558
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,460
over the marginal product of
capital, which we remember

559
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,830
called last time
the marginal rate

560
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:45,883
of technical substitution,
is going to be equal to w/r--

561
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,550
actually, the negative
of these is going

562
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,290
to be equal to each other.

563
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,915
But we'll just cross
out the negatives.

564
00:23:49,915 --> 00:23:52,540
So the negative of
MPL over MPK, which

565
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,240
we called the marginal rate
of technical substitution,

566
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,780
is equal to the negative of w/r.

567
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,602
The slope, the optimal
point, is where

568
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:03,310
the marginal rate of
technical subsection

569
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:09,650
equals the slope, which is
the wage to rental rate ratio.

570
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,150
Alternatively-- I don't know
if anyone besides me likes this

571
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:22,620
intuition-- we can rewrite
this as MPL/w equals MPK/r,

572
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,170
my bang-for-the-buck
formulation that I like--

573
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,310
that the next dollar
of wages, if you ask,

574
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,070
should I spend next dollar
on wages or machines,

575
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,770
you should do it until
the next dollar of wages

576
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,260
delivers you the same return
as the next dollar of machines.

577
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,370
This is what you get for the
next dollar of wages, MPL/w.

578
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,100
This it what you get for the
next dollar of machines, MPK/r.

579
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,590
You want to continue to trade
off machines and workers

580
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,900
until that condition is true.

581
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,600
So let's actually now solve
for this for our example.

582
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,850
Let's actually solve for that.

583
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,500
If we solve for this, we know
that the marginal product

584
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:14,700
of labor, which is dq dL, is 0.5
times K over square root of K

585
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,910
times L. And the marginal
product of capital,

586
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:26,820
which is dq dK, equals 0.5
times L over the square root--

587
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,015
0.5 times L over the square
root of K times L. Just taking

588
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:32,390
the derivative of
the-- all I did

589
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,070
was take the derivative of
the production function.

590
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,928
So therefore, putting
these together,

591
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:40,720
we're going to-- we
know that marginal rate

592
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,840
of technical substitution
in this example

593
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,620
is equal to minus K over L.
That's not a general formula.

594
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,898
That's just this example.

595
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:53,690
The marginal rate of
technical substitution

596
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,610
is equal to the negative of
the ratio of capital to labor.

597
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,170
We also know that
the wage rate--

598
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,720
we also know we want to set
this equal to the negative

599
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,750
of the wage rate--

600
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm sorry, the wage
rental rate ratio.

601
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,170
And we know that's negative 1/2.

602
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:18,030
We know that's a 1/2, because
that's 5 and that's 10.

603
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,540
So we want to set the marginal
rate of technical substitution

604
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,880
to the wage rental
rate ratio, which

605
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,120
means we set minus K over
L equal to minus 1/2.

606
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,890
Or at the optimum, that means
that your labor, your capital,

607
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,080
at the optimum-- that means
the amount of capital--

608
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,830
should be half as much
as the amount of labor.

609
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:45,390
In this example, we just solved
for the efficient combination

610
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,980
of inputs, the
efficient combination

611
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:52,210
is you should use capital
to labor in a ratio of 1/2.

612
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,890
You should use half as
much capital as use labor.

613
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,140
So let me pause there.

614
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,120
And let's talk about
where this is coming from.

615
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,002
Yeah.

616
00:27:02,002 --> 00:27:04,460
AUDIENCE: So does that mean
that at any given price of cost

617
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,540
[INAUDIBLE] line, that is
the optimal point where

618
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,790
it will be tangent [INAUDIBLE]

619
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,900
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

620
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,630
Exactly.

621
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,180
That's the graphic intuition.

622
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,010
Let's come to the
economics intuition.

623
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,190
The economics intuition
is the following.

624
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,540
The production function
delivers this relationship--

625
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,540
that the marginal rate
of technical substitution

626
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,860
was minus K over
L. In other words,

627
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,178
when you're producing goods,
given this production function

628
00:27:30,178 --> 00:27:31,970
you're indifferent
between the next machine

629
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,803
and the next worker.

630
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:34,928
That's just the way this
production function worked

631
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:35,450
out--

632
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,850
that one more machine
delivers you the same amount

633
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,550
as one more worker.

634
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,660
Now, I've just told
you that one machine

635
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,580
costs half of one more worker.

636
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,110
So which you want more of?

637
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,100
No?

638
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,370
One machine delivers the
same return as one worker.

639
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,960
You want more workers.

640
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,660
Workers cost half machines,
they're equally productive,

641
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,330
so you want more workers.

642
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,400
So the optimal
amount of machines

643
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,140
is going to be half as many
as the number of workers.

644
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,380
You want more workers,
because you're indifferent--

645
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,910
look at that
production function.

646
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,190
You're indifferent.

647
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,290
You don't give a shit
about L versus K.

648
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,190
They're the same to you.

649
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,180
You're a hard capitalist, man.

650
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,770
Machine or worker,
you don't care.

651
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,950
But the market's telling you
you can get a worker for half

652
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,710
the price of a machine.

653
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,660
So you, as a good cost
minimizing capitalist,

654
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,415
take twice as many
workers as machines.

655
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,835
And that's the outcome
that you get here.

656
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:42,710
Questions about that?

657
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,080
OK.

658
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,990
So that's basically what
we do to derive this.

659
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:57,360
Now, what I want to do is
take this and then derive

660
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,470
our ultimate goal, which is,
what is the long run cost

661
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,430
function?

662
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,860
That's sort of what we--
why we started this lecture.

663
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,318
What is the long
run cost function?

664
00:29:06,318 --> 00:29:07,215
Let's do the math.

665
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:08,790
We'll do the math in five steps.

666
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:19,880
Step one, q equals square
root of K times L. Step two,

667
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,040
we know from up there
that K/L equals w/r.

668
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:30,295
We derived that, leading us
to the conclusion that K--

669
00:29:30,295 --> 00:29:31,920
lead us to the
conclusion that K equals

670
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,180
1/2 L. We just derived that.

671
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:46,450
Therefore, we can rewrite q as
the square root of 1/2 times L

672
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:52,150
squared, just substituting
it, because K equals 1/2 L.

673
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,860
Therefore, we can
solve for L is going

674
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,760
to be square root of 2 over q.

675
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:10,330
And K is going to be square
root of 2 over 2 over q.

676
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:22,090
L is square root of 2 over q,
K is square root of 2 over 2

677
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,480
over q.

678
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,960
I'm sorry-- no, not over q.

679
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,460
I'm sorry.

680
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,810
That's my bed.

681
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,920
Error.

682
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,550
Error.

683
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,290
Go back.

684
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,600
Should always look at my notes.

685
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,590
It's square root of 2 times q.

686
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,610
My bad.

687
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,290
L is square root of 2 times q.

688
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,460
And K is square root
of 2 over 2 times q.

689
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,060
OK.

690
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,110
Therefore, armed
with this L and K,

691
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,990
we can rewrite
our cost function.

692
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:03,990
So step five is that the cost
function-- given this stuff,

693
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:11,824
the cost function equals r
times square root of 2 times q--

694
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:14,880
I'm sorry, r times square
root of 2 over 2 times q--

695
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,180
plus w times square
root of 2 times q.

696
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,740
I just plugged in the optimal
L and K into my cost function.

697
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:29,260
Now I can plug in
the 10 and the 5

698
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:38,170
to get C equals 10 times
square root of 2 times q.

699
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,040
And I'm done.

700
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,992
I just derived
the cost function.

701
00:31:41,992 --> 00:31:43,200
That's what we came here for.

702
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,143
This is what you got up this
morning and wanted to see.

703
00:31:46,143 --> 00:31:47,560
You got up this
morning, you said,

704
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,210
I want to know how
does the cost of a firm

705
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,220
vary with the
quantity it produces?

706
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,400
And I've just told you.

707
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,010
This tells you how
the costs that you pay

708
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,660
vary the quantity you produce.

709
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,740
And I did that by deriving
the optimal mix of L and K

710
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:08,180
you want to use, and
then simply imposing

711
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,802
the prices of those two,
and I get a cost function.

712
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:12,612
Yeah.

713
00:32:12,612 --> 00:32:14,570
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't you
be adding the two terms?

714
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:14,840
JONATHAN GRUBER: I'm sorry?

715
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,670
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't you
be adding the two terms?

716
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,930
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Which two terms?

717
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,380
Oh, I see.

718
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,880
Yeah, plus.

719
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,490
I'm sorry.

720
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,100
You're right.

721
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,600
My bad.

722
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,490
That's a plus.

723
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,010
Thanks.

724
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,230
This is the most math I'll
do in a lecture all year,

725
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,503
you'll be pleased to know.

726
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:30,170
It's why it's my least
favorite lecture.

727
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:30,670
Yeah?

728
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,700
AUDIENCE: So is
five generally true?

729
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,210
JONATHAN GRUBER: You mean this
particular functional form?

730
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:37,580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

731
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,180
JONATHAN GRUBER: No.

732
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,800
This is all dependent
on that production

733
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,717
function I wrote down.

734
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:42,830
What's generally true is this--

735
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,300
or actually, K wouldn't be--

736
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,767
what's generally true
is just C equals--

737
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:48,350
in the long run,
what's generally true

738
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,310
is C equals wL plus rK.

739
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,020
That's what's generally true.

740
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,830
I just made--

741
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,310
But what I've showed you
is, given three things--

742
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,240
a production-- all I gave you
was a production function,

743
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,210
a wage rate, and a rental rate.

744
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,400
Given those three
things, you can then

745
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,880
derive the cost function.

746
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,042
Given those three things, you
can derive the cost function.

747
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:16,500
In fact, given two things you
can derive the cost function.

748
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,632
You could actually derive the
cost function given one thing--

749
00:33:19,632 --> 00:33:21,090
given just the
production function,

750
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:25,750
derive the cost function as a
function of these input prices.

751
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,340
OK.

752
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,000
So that's a lot of
results from one function,

753
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,340
from one production function.

754
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,380
Now, other question about this?

755
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,470
Other math I got wrong?

756
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,530
Sorry about that.

757
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,180
Yeah.

758
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,920
AUDIENCE: Sorry, could you
just repeat the three inputs

759
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,520
that you were using?

760
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,760
JONATHAN GRUBER:
[INAUDIBLE] all I used.

761
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,810
Somebody tell me.

762
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,270
What do you need to get
the magical cost function?

763
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,080
What three things do you need?

764
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,490
Yeah.

765
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,362
AUDIENCE: w and r and then q.

766
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:54,170
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, w, r, and--

767
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:54,923
what about q?

768
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:56,840
You need q, but what
about-- what do you need?

769
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,297
w, r, and the
production function.

770
00:34:00,297 --> 00:34:01,880
So armed with the
production function,

771
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,990
that mathematical equation, this
mathematical equation, w and r,

772
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:07,580
I'm done.

773
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,080
Everything I've
done in this lecture

774
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,750
comes from those three things.

775
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,219
The math is hard and annoying.

776
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,380
We will have you practice it.

777
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,380
You will not like it.

778
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,820
OK.

779
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,320
It's just kind of
what you've got to do.

780
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,820
All right?

781
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,695
I don't like it, you're
not going to like it.

782
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,237
It's just what we've
got to do to get

783
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:26,510
to the more interesting stuff.

784
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,010
OK?

785
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,800
Yeah.

786
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,620
AUDIENCE: Is the bar on the K?

787
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,260
JONATHAN GRUBER: It's
fixed in the short run.

788
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:32,998
The bar on the--

789
00:34:32,998 --> 00:34:34,540
shouldn't see a bar
on a K over here.

790
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,159
That's all over here when
I was doing the short run.

791
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,080
Yeah?

792
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,212
AUDIENCE: Can you use r and w in
order to get to the fifth step?

793
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,920
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
we needed r and w.

794
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,040
AUDIENCE: Well, in the
sense that, to simplify,

795
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,856
K equals 1/2 L?

796
00:34:46,856 --> 00:34:47,882
JONATHAN GRUBER: To K--

797
00:34:47,882 --> 00:34:48,590
oh, you're right.

798
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,159
That's a good point.

799
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,420
I needed r and w back here.

800
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:50,962
You're right.

801
00:34:50,962 --> 00:34:52,520
That's a good point.

802
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,310
Good point.

803
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,970
But I still could have done this
whole thing as a function of r

804
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,239
and w if I wanted to--

805
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,300
if I wanted to really
screw up my math.

806
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,180
All right?

807
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,900
OK.

808
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,820
So now, armed with
this, let's talk

809
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,598
about what happens when
input prices change.

810
00:35:05,598 --> 00:35:07,140
We talked about with
consumer theory,

811
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,510
what happens when the price
of pizza and cookies change.

812
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,900
What happens when the price
of labor and capital changes?

813
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,200
What does that do?

814
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,470
So let's talk about
changes in input prices.

815
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,230
OK.

816
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,310
Let's go to figure 6-4.

817
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,490
And let's look at, with the
same production function,

818
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,990
square root of L times K-- we're
not changing our production

819
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:33,180
function-- we're going to
change the wage rental ratio.

820
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:45,090
So line-- we have our initial
line, our initial wage rental

821
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:54,210
ratio, which is that basically
you have a wage rate,

822
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,473
but the budget constraint,
essentially, that's flatter

823
00:35:57,473 --> 00:35:58,890
is our original
budget constraint.

824
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,320
The flatter budget constraint is
our original budget constraint.

825
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,570
That's the budget constraint
with the price of capital

826
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,860
of $10 and a wage of $5.

827
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,830
And that intersects our
isoquant at point x.

828
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:14,020
So we chose five units of labor.

829
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,960
Now we have a new--

830
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,463
we chose five units of labor
and two and a half machines.

831
00:36:19,463 --> 00:36:20,380
That was our original.

832
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,797
This is sort of a
messed up graph.

833
00:36:21,797 --> 00:36:25,560
But our original
intersection was at point x.

834
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,270
The cost minimizing
combination, the square root

835
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:33,010
of 12.5 production, was to have
five workers and two and a half

836
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,450
machines.

837
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,870
Now let's say the price
of workers rises to $10.

838
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,690
The wage rate rises
to $10 an hour.

839
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:44,550
So now, workers and
machines cost the same.

840
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:49,430
What is now the optimal mix
of workers and machines?

841
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,610
Well, graphically
we know we still

842
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,430
want to produce the
square root of 12.5.

843
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,660
So we want to stay tangent
to the same isoquant.

844
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,040
So based on-- what
we're saying is,

845
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,000
this is as if we said to
consumers, keep your utility

846
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,280
changed, change the price.

847
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,442
What do we call that?

848
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:12,650
Remember what we called that?

849
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:16,550
Keeping utility constant,
changing the price?

850
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,280
Anyone remember
what we call that?

851
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,900
Who said that?

852
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,400
All right.

853
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,140
Raise your hand next.

854
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,740
Be proud.

855
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,442
Substitution effect.

856
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:24,650
That's the substation effect.

857
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,650
It's the same idea here.

858
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,570
We want to know, for a
given level of production,

859
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:32,190
what happens as the price
of the inputs change?

860
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,060
And so we shift along
the isoquant for point x

861
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,920
to point y.

862
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,860
And you'll see we
choose a mix where

863
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,660
we use fewer workers
and more machines.

864
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:51,270
And just as the substitution
effect is always nonpositive,

865
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,570
this shift as the wage
rate rises, the price

866
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,380
of the good, the x-axis rises.

867
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,540
You will unambiguously use
no more, and almost certainly

868
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,700
less, workers.

869
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,700
OK.

870
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,690
And you can see
that graphically--

871
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,420
think about graphically,
you're looking

872
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,750
for the tangency between
this curve and the line.

873
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,780
The slope of the line
just got steeper.

874
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,150
Therefore, you must move
to the left on the curve.

875
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,540
It's the same proof as we
used the substitution effect,

876
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,020
where substitution effect
was always nonpositive.

877
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,550
OK.

878
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,960
It's the same intuition
here we use for y.

879
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,730
A rise in the wage
rate will lead

880
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,960
you to hire fewer workers
and more machines.

881
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,130
Guess what?

882
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,177
You just entered the
debate on the minimum wage.

883
00:38:35,177 --> 00:38:37,260
And if you follow the
debate in minimum wage, what

884
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,043
do people say?

885
00:38:38,043 --> 00:38:40,210
Well, if you raise the wage
you have to pay workers,

886
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,543
they'll be replaced by machines.

887
00:38:41,543 --> 00:38:43,520
That's this.

888
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,250
This is the math-- this is
the mathematical and graphical

889
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,590
intuition behind the debate
on minimum wage, which we'll

890
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,310
get into later in the semester.

891
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,920
But the basic idea
of that debate

892
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,695
is, gee, if you force firms
to pay more to workers,

893
00:38:54,695 --> 00:38:56,570
they're going to substitute
towards machines.

894
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,790
That's exactly right, in theory.

895
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,810
And practice, there's
a lot of complications.

896
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,435
But this gives you the theory of
why people make that argument.

897
00:39:03,435 --> 00:39:04,160
Yeah.

898
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,790
AUDIENCE: So in this example,
only the wage for workers

899
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,460
[INAUDIBLE] not the machines.

900
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,942
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Not the machine.

901
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:16,220
AUDIENCE: So why
does the isocost not

902
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,685
have the same y-intercept?

903
00:39:18,685 --> 00:39:20,060
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Ah, great point.

904
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,880
Because here I'm drawing a new--

905
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,750
I am drawing the isocost that I
would use while still producing

906
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,870
square root of 12.5.

907
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,150
So that's it's just the
substitution effect.

908
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,917
I'm not drawing the full set
of isocosts at the new price.

909
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm just saying, to produce
the same amount what's

910
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,125
my new-- if I want to
produce the same amount, what

911
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,960
combination do I
now have to use?

912
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,930
OK?

913
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:44,551
Yeah.

914
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,910
AUDIENCE: The total cost
of production [INAUDIBLE]..

915
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,340
JONATHAN GRUBER: The total
cost of production-- let's see.

916
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,540
Yeah, it has to be-- no.

917
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,040
Let's see.

918
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,832
No, total cost doesn't
have to be the same.

919
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:56,690
The total cost used to be
five workers at $5 an hour,

920
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,030
that's $25.

921
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,660
So it used to be $50.

922
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,190
Now what is it?

923
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,320
Now it's $70.

924
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,505
The total cost has gone up.

925
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:06,880
AUDIENCE: So it's not like
the budget constraint or the--

926
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,610
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

927
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,480
It's not like the
budget constraint

928
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,310
where your income is fixed.

929
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,120
That's what's hard
about producer theory.

930
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,430
Because basically,
the budget constraint

931
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,950
was sort of asking,
keeping your budget fixed.

932
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,890
This is like asking, keeping
your total production fixed.

933
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,560
And so now you have
to pay more to get

934
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,420
that level of production.

935
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,260
OK?

936
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,400
Good questions.

937
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,150
OK.

938
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,770
Now, ultimately what
does this lead to?

939
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,890
So that gives us our
change in input prices.

940
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,830
Other questions about that?

941
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,240
Now, remember I said at the
beginning of the lecture,

942
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,810
we are first going
to solve for what

943
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,720
is the cost
minimizing combination

944
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,500
of inputs for a given quantity?

945
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,880
We derived that up there.

946
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,110
It's half as much--

947
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,880
going back to our
old prices, it's

948
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,010
half as much capital as labor.

949
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,680
Now we want to ask,
how does your cost

950
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,080
change as the quantity changes?

951
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,820
And we call that the
long run expansion path.

952
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,570
The long run
expansion path, which

953
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:08,780
is, how do your costs
expand as you produce more?

954
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,580
And we see that in figure 6-5.

955
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,680
In figure 6-5, we show
the particular case

956
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,720
of a linear long
run expansion path.

957
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,520
That's what you get
in this example.

958
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,110
It's a particular case.

959
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:26,660
What this case says is, at
any given level of production,

960
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:30,740
the optimal mix of labor
and capital is the same.

961
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,490
In other words, you
always want to have--

962
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,340
essentially, given
the price of labor

963
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,880
is half the price of
capital, you always

964
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,020
want to have twice as
many workers as machines.

965
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,420
So if you want to produce
square root of 12.5,

966
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,540
you want five workers and
two and a half machines.

967
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,550
If you want to produce
square root of 50,

968
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,110
you want 10 workers
and 5 machines.

969
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,630
If you want to produce
square root of 112.5,

970
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,420
you want 15 workers
and 7 and 1/2 machines.

971
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,180
So the long run-- given
this production function,

972
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,040
the long run expansion
path is linear.

973
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,340
You always want the same
ratio of workers to machines.

974
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,869
Yeah.

975
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:08,681
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
consumer and firms,

976
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:10,290
is the reason why
we don't necessarily

977
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:13,288
have a strict budget,
per se, and then isn't

978
00:42:13,288 --> 00:42:15,455
the idea that if we really
want increase production,

979
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:17,080
we can take a loan out?

980
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,140
JONATHAN GRUBER: This
is what I tried to say.

981
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,450
It's sort of-- I always say
it over here, but it's hard,

982
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,742
and we have to come back to it.

983
00:42:20,742 --> 00:42:22,840
The reason producer
theory is harder

984
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,960
is because we're not
given a fixed constant we

985
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,340
are with consumers.

986
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,920
Consumers, we're saying, look--

987
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,420
you've got a resource, you've
got to constrain maximization.

988
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,060
We haven't constrained
the maximization yet.

989
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,350
There's another
constraint we need.

990
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,933
They have an extra degree of
freedom relative to consumers.

991
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:42,100
Now, in fact, consumers
have degree of freedom, too.

992
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,267
When you grow up, your
parents don't give you money.

993
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:45,434
You decide how much to make.

994
00:42:45,434 --> 00:42:47,267
So in reality, consumers--
you can do this--

995
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:49,027
will have the same
degrees of freedom.

996
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:50,860
But we started with the
easy consumer theory

997
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,603
case, where you constrict-- we
took away a degree of freedom.

998
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:55,270
Now we're writing it
back, which is, you

999
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,740
can choose how much to produce.

1000
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,720
Like, you being able choose
your income as a consumer.

1001
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,303
That leads to long
run expansion path.

1002
00:43:01,303 --> 00:43:02,803
Let me go on, because
I want to make

1003
00:43:02,803 --> 00:43:04,090
sure I get through this stuff.

1004
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:04,780
OK?

1005
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,990
Now, the long run expansion
path does not have to be linear.

1006
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:14,090
So think about-- look
at figure 6-5b and 6-5c.

1007
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:19,870
So 6-5b is a long run expansion
path for a production function

1008
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:23,680
such that capital becomes
less productive the more you

1009
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,200
produce.

1010
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,200
I don't have the example
of production function.

1011
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,300
But when you write down
production functions which

1012
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,180
have the feature that the
more you produce the less

1013
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,728
productive capital
becomes, the less

1014
00:43:33,728 --> 00:43:35,645
each additional unit
capital helps [INAUDIBLE]

1015
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:38,110
additional unit of workers.

1016
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,360
So you know, we could
think of this roughly as

1017
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,600
sort of like a fast
food restaurant.

1018
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,300
That kind of-- you
know, each addition--

1019
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,290
that basically,
there's so much stuff

1020
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,420
to do where workers can
efficiently share tasks

1021
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,232
and things.

1022
00:43:50,232 --> 00:43:52,690
Each additional worker-- that
the marginal product of labor

1023
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,670
essentially diminishes
less quickly

1024
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:58,260
than the marginal
product of capital.

1025
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,450
On the other hand,
in figure 6-5c

1026
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:04,440
we can have a long run expansion
path where labor becomes less

1027
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,640
productive relative to capital.

1028
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,300
Think of it as like
heavy machinery,

1029
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,100
where basically all workers
can do is run the machine.

1030
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,410
So that second worker--

1031
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,215
workers don't really do much
but sit there and flip a switch.

1032
00:44:16,215 --> 00:44:17,840
You need the worker
to flip the switch.

1033
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,632
That's all they do.

1034
00:44:18,632 --> 00:44:21,210
So the second worker, you're
already flipping the switch.

1035
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,543
So really, adding more machines
is a more productive way

1036
00:44:23,543 --> 00:44:25,880
to expand the output.

1037
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,570
None of these is right or wrong.

1038
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:32,100
We're just saying that the
shape of this expansion path

1039
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,700
can basically vary
with how much--

1040
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,830
with different
production functions.

1041
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:41,730
But they're all the same idea.

1042
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:47,700
Now, so basically,
that tells you--

1043
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,980
but here's the bottom line
that we wanted to come to.

1044
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,300
That long run expansion path
is a long run cost curve.

1045
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:00,650
So ultimately, if
you want to ask,

1046
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,250
how do my costs vary
with how much I produce,

1047
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,370
this curve tells you.

1048
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,870
Because what it does, it says,
for every level of production

1049
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,190
I'll tell you the optimal
combination of L and K.

1050
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,280
Given the price of L and K,
that will tell you the costs.

1051
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,170
And so you trace out the costs
with every level of production.

1052
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,570
This is your cost curve.

1053
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,790
This long run expansion
path tells you

1054
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,268
what the costs are for
every level of production.

1055
00:45:24,268 --> 00:45:25,810
And it tells you
that, because you've

1056
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,170
made-- you're doing the
efficient level of production.

1057
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,710
That's what the long run
expansion path is telling you.

1058
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,210
OK.

1059
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,530
This is hard.

1060
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,205
I'm about to make it harder.

1061
00:45:35,205 --> 00:45:36,580
Which is, we're
now going to talk

1062
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,715
about the relationship between
short run costs and long run

1063
00:45:40,715 --> 00:45:41,215
costs.

1064
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:49,110
And the key insight is that
long run costs are everywhere

1065
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,745
lower than short run costs.

1066
00:45:50,745 --> 00:45:53,370
Without looking at the figure--
because the figure doesn't help

1067
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,150
with this--

1068
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,740
why does that make sense?

1069
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,830
Why our long run costs--

1070
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:02,430
why, if you can optimize
over the long run,

1071
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,960
will you always
have costs that are

1072
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,670
no higher, and in general lower,
than optimizing the short run?

1073
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,310
Yeah.

1074
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] already
had the right capital.

1075
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:14,705
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Because you have

1076
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:15,965
an extra degree of freedom.

1077
00:46:15,965 --> 00:46:17,590
I think that's
LeChatelier's Principle.

1078
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:19,480
Is that right, for
the chemists among us?

1079
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,280
That basically,
like-- essentially,

1080
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,993
an extra degree
of freedom means,

1081
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:24,910
the more you can optimize
over, the better you

1082
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,822
can do in optimizing.

1083
00:46:25,822 --> 00:46:27,280
In the short run
you're constrained

1084
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,923
by the size of the building.

1085
00:46:28,923 --> 00:46:30,340
In the long run,
you could choose.

1086
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,470
So let's-- to see that,
let's go to figure 6-6.

1087
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:36,100
This is a confusing figure.

1088
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,770
So bear with me as I
walk you through it.

1089
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:39,430
OK?

1090
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,420
Consider a firm with three
possible sizes of plants.

1091
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,070
They're going to build a plant.

1092
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,803
So the capital here
is the building.

1093
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,220
And there's three
possible sizes--

1094
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,420
small, medium, and large.

1095
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:57,390
The small plant has
the curve SRAC1.

1096
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,840
What does that curve mean?

1097
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,840
That means that
the small plant--

1098
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,430
I'm sorry, the small
plant is SRAC2,

1099
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:07,160
the medium plant is SRAC2,
and the large plant has SRAC3.

1100
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,500
Compare SRAC1 to SRAC3.

1101
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,710
What this is saying is, for
small quantities of production,

1102
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,780
SRAC1 lies below SRAC3.

1103
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,300
For small quantities production,
if you extend SRAC3 out,

1104
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:30,960
you see at levels of
production like q1 or even q2,

1105
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,220
SRAC3 is way above SRAC1.

1106
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,590
When you go to a level
of production like q3,

1107
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,820
SRAC1, if you extend
that dashed line out,

1108
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,310
is going to be much,
much higher than SRAC3.

1109
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:47,100
So the right-- and
SRAC2 is in between.

1110
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,380
So essentially, for different
levels of production

1111
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,050
these give the different
optimal short run cost curves.

1112
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,550
In the long run,
you get to choose.

1113
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,220
So the long run
average cost curve

1114
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:03,690
is the lower envelope of the
short run average cost curves.

1115
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,270
Because in the long run
you say, well, here's

1116
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,680
my production level.

1117
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,920
I know in the long run--

1118
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,250
so if I know I'm going
to build a lot of things,

1119
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,170
I choose SRAC3.

1120
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,790
I choose the biggest plant.

1121
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:17,010
If I know my production
is going to be low,

1122
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,750
I choose the smallest plant.

1123
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,280
But I can optimize
in the long run

1124
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,120
by choosing the right sized
plant for my production level.

1125
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,683
This is hard.

1126
00:48:24,683 --> 00:48:26,100
And I'm almost out
of time, so let

1127
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,040
me end with an example that
perfectly illustrates this.

1128
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,240
Tesla.

1129
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:30,810
Elon Musk.

1130
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:33,510
Everybody's favorite
guy these days.

1131
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,230
Tesla, when they came
out, had to decide

1132
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:38,655
how big a plant to build--

1133
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,780
how many batteries to make.

1134
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:43,140
Batteries are the key
[INAUDIBLE] Teslas.

1135
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,980
And they expected to make--
to have demand for 20,000 cars

1136
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,050
by the year 2017.

1137
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,740
So they built a
plant like SRAC1.

1138
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,960
They built a plant that
was the efficient plant

1139
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,360
to produce 20,000 cars.

1140
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,557
The problem is, demand
was for 200,000 cars.

1141
00:49:01,557 --> 00:49:03,640
And as a result, there's
a three-year waiting list

1142
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,032
to get Teslas.

1143
00:49:05,032 --> 00:49:07,240
It turned out that was not
the right size to produce.

1144
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,400
They lost money--
relative to the optimum.

1145
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,150
They made money.

1146
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,380
Musk is incredibly rich.

1147
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,005
But they didn't do what was most
efficient given the underlying

1148
00:49:14,005 --> 00:49:14,810
demand.

1149
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:18,100
But now, Musk can re-optimize.

1150
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,900
Now he's saying, wait a second.

1151
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,580
People want way more cars.

1152
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,200
Well, producing them
at the tiny plant

1153
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,400
was exorbitantly expensive.

1154
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,990
I had to run it
over and overtime--

1155
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,000
pay workers overtime.

1156
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,670
To produce 200k cars
in that tiny plant

1157
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,250
just was exorbitantly expensive.

1158
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,290
That's if you take that dashed
line and extend it way the hell

1159
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:32,950
up.

1160
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:36,950
The SRAC1 extended way the
hell up, incredibly expensive.

1161
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,500
So what is Musk doing now?

1162
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,710
Building the largest
battery plant in the world.

1163
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,870
In Nevada, he is
building a battery plant

1164
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:47,200
that can produce batteries
for 500,000 cars.

1165
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,560
So he shifted from
SRAC1 to SRAC3.

1166
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,660
He's now saying
in the long run, I

1167
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,660
can more-- if I'm going
to produce 200,000 cars,

1168
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,020
I can do that more efficiently
with a giant battery plant.

1169
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,563
And that's what he's doing.

1170
00:50:00,563 --> 00:50:01,480
So he's re-optimizing.

1171
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,798
Now, what if Musk is wrong?

1172
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:07,090
What if it turns out Teslas
suck and people are like, I

1173
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:07,830
don't want them anymore?

1174
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:10,205
Someone else-- or, you know,
Chevy finally figures it out

1175
00:50:10,205 --> 00:50:11,888
and makes a good electric car.

1176
00:50:11,888 --> 00:50:13,930
Then what's going to happen
is he's going to have

1177
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,720
made a mistake in the long run.

1178
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,750
Then the third period, he'll go
back to a smaller plant again.

1179
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,450
But he always can do what's
efficient in the long run,

1180
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,130
given the underlying demand.

1181
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,400
So Tesla is an example of this
sort of long run, short run

1182
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:27,937
dichotomy.

1183
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:29,770
Anyway, it's a lot of
stuff for one lecture.

1184
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:32,350
We'll come back next time,
talk more about costs.

1185
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:35,730
And then we'll start
getting into competition.
