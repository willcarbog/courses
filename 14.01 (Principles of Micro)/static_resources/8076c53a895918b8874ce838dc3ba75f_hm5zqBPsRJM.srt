JONATHAN GRUBER: So
today, we're going

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,200
to talk about social insurance.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,990
So why do we have this thing
called "social insurance?"

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,740
Let's first talk about what
social insurance is, and then

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,650
ask why we have it.

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,040
So basically,
social insurance is

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,700
government-provided
insurance programs.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,950
This is the largest
single category

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,680
of government expenditure
in the US today,

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,770
is government-provided
insurance programs.

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,142
Now, why do we have these?

15
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:46,100
You might say, well, we
know why we have these.

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,870
We learned about uncertainty.

17
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,310
We already talked about how
people dislike uncertainty,

18
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,970
and about how as a
result, insurance

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,070
is big business in America.

20
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,640
Private insurance
for health, for auto,

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,650
for life, for
property and casualty

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,380
adds up to about $1.5
trillion every year.

23
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,090
So we already have big
business of private insurance.

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,220
So why does the government
need to get involved?

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,280
I mean, after all,
people want insurance

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,730
if they're risk averse.

27
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,450
We talked about insurance
markets can work.

28
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,970
And as always in economics,
the question is, what's

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,260
wrong with the private market?

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,605
What is the market failure
that might generate interest

31
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:28,280
in government being involved?

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,218
And the market failure in
the context of insurance

33
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:33,760
is a different kind
of market failure

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,520
than we've talked about.

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,937
We've talked about
market failures

36
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:39,050
like imperfect competition
as a market failure.

37
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,473
We talked about externalities
as a market failure.

38
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:43,890
The new kind of market failure
we want to talk about today

39
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,690
is what we call
"information asymmetry."

40
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:00,770
Information asymmetry,
basically which

41
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,980
is the difference
in the information

42
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,479
available to sellers and to
buyers in a given market.

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,150
So far in this course, we sort
of assumed full information.

44
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,220
We've assumed everybody
knows everything.

45
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,340
We weaken that assumption a
little bit with uncertainty,

46
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,530
and say that people don't
know whether they're

47
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,322
going to be sick or
healthy, but they still

48
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,740
knew the probabilities.

49
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,025
Now we weaken it further
by saying not only is

50
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,600
the information imperfect,
but different parties

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,700
in a transaction might
have different levels

52
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,960
of information.

53
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,390
And that's going to turn
out to cause market failure.

54
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,123
That information asymmetry
will cause market failure.

55
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:42,790
Now, the math here
is quite hard, harder

56
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,450
than we do in this class.

57
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,710
So we'll just sort of do
this by an example or two.

58
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,500
And the best example
to start with

59
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,790
is the so-called
"lemons problem"

60
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,760
that was laid out by the Nobel
Prize-winning economist George

61
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,590
Akerlof in 1970, Nobel
Prize-winning economist

62
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,560
and husband of former Fed
Chairman Janet Yellen--

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,150
quite a power couple.

64
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,660
And here's what Akerlof
laid out-- he said,

65
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,330
let's look at the
market for used cars.

66
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,710
This is the market for
used cars as of 1970.

67
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,380
There's no CarFax.

68
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,120
There was none of
this information.

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,340
In 1970, when you went
to buy a used car,

70
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,965
you sort of went,
and kicked the tires,

71
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:24,580
and decided if you're
going to buy it.

72
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,170
So this is a classic case
of an information asymmetry,

73
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,760
in that someone selling a car
knows what's wrong with it,

74
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,530
whereas the person
buying the car doesn't.

75
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,300
I'll go sort of kick the
tires and hope for the best.

76
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:47,030
So basically, in
particular, sellers of cars

77
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,250
might be selling them
because they're not good.

78
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,230
After all, why sell a car?

79
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,375
Maybe because it's
what's called a "lemon."

80
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:57,080
A lemon is something which is
a poorly performing product,

81
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,280
in this case a car that's
got something wrong with it.

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,470
So when you go to buy
a car, you're worried.

83
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,840
You want to buy a car
in the used car market,

84
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,860
but you're worried.

85
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,390
Why is someone selling this car?

86
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,000
You should be.

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,440
Why is someone selling this car?

88
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,420
If it's really in good shape,
why would they be selling it?

89
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,300
Therefore, as a
result, Akerlof argued,

90
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,970
there might be a collapse of
the entire used car market.

91
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,470
There might not be
transactions that

92
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,440
happen that can make
both parties better off.

93
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,210
Remember, a market failure is
whenever the private market

94
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,600
fails to maximize welfare.

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,930
What that means is
a market failure

96
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,150
arises whatever the
private market does not

97
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,530
deliver all transactions that
make buyer and seller better

98
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,020
off.

99
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,810
And so let's look at
an example of this.

100
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,900
Suppose that I have
a 10-year-old car,

101
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,880
and I keep it in pristine shape.

102
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,130
Hint-- that's not true for me.

103
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,255
I'm terrible at cars, but
imagine I was someone who

104
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:56,380
wasn't.

105
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,570
I kept my 10-year-old
car in pristine shape.

106
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,720
And let's say that a 10-year-old
car in pristine shape is--

107
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,580
and let's say I'm
trying to sell this car.

108
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,670
And let's say that
I would happily

109
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,410
take $5,000 for this 10-year-old
car that's in pristine shape.

110
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:22,220
So I would be willing to sell at
$5 K. And let's say that you--

111
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,190
let's say Patricia--
needs that used car,

112
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:32,830
and she is willing to buy a car
that's in good shape for $6 K.

113
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:40,360
So my willingness to provide,
willingness to supply, is $5 K.

114
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,600
Her willingness to pay is $6 K.

115
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,700
So that is a transaction
that should happen.

116
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,030
Given the quality of my car,
given that's in good shape,

117
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,190
she is willing to pay
$1,000 more than I'm

118
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,660
willing to sell it for.

119
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,210
So that transaction
should happen,

120
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,670
and it would be
welfare maximizing.

121
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,360
But let's say that most
10-year-old cars are not

122
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,340
in good shape.

123
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,270
Most 10-year-old cars, in fact,
are in kind of crappy shape.

124
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,020
And in fact, for the typical
10-year-old car, to get it up

125
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,610
and running well,
you'd have to throw

126
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,810
$2,000 in once you bought it.

127
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,580
And Patricia knows this.

128
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,950
She knows that for the
typical 10-year-old car,

129
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,840
she would have to put $2,000 in.

130
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,620
So her willingness
to pay is not $6 K,

131
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,512
it's $4 K for an
average 10-year-old car.

132
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:31,970
Now I say to
Patricia, well, that's

133
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,440
an average
10-year-old car, but I

134
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,130
have a perfect 10-year-old car.

135
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,680
You don't need to
put $2 K into it.

136
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,443
It's good to go.

137
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:40,610
So why don't we split the
difference and pay $5.5 K.

138
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,740
She says, no way.

139
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,430
You're a damn liar.

140
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,130
I have no way of knowing your
car is better than average.

141
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,840
All I know is the
average 10-year-old car

142
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,410
needs $2,000 of work.

143
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,940
So I'm not going to pay more
than $4,000 for your car.

144
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,230
As a result, Patricia
doesn't buy my car.

145
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,750
And a transaction that would
have made both parties better

146
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,790
off does not happen.

147
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,925
A transaction where there
was full information,

148
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:04,300
like we have much
more of today--

149
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,370
we can get the entire
record of the car,

150
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,220
all the crashes its been in, how
much care it's taken care of--

151
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,220
that problem would go
away, should go away,

152
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,410
because now, Patricia
could look at my CarFax

153
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,900
and note this, in fact,
is a pristine car.

154
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,760
And she's more willing
to pay the $6,000 for it.

155
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,110
But the bottom line is,
in this world of 1970,

156
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,010
this was a market failure,
because a transaction that

157
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,040
made both parties better
off did not happen because

158
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,860
of imperfect information.

159
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,980
The buyer was
perfectly happy to buy.

160
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,180
Patricia is perfectly
happy to buy my car,

161
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,880
but because I had information
that she didn't and she

162
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,480
was just suspicious that
I was lying, as a result,

163
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,930
that transaction didn't happen.

164
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,810
Now, questions about that?

165
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,920
People understand
it's a market failure.

166
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,220
Now we come to insurance.

167
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,790
The story is flipped.

168
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,383
Now it's not the seller
that has the information.

169
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:03,050
It's the buyer that
has the information.

170
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,600
In particular, when
you buy insurance,

171
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,030
you know how healthy you are.

172
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,770
You know your genetic history.

173
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,665
You know whether
you're a risk taker.

174
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,790
You know whether you're
around a lot of snotty kids

175
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,147
who might get you sick.

176
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:16,730
You know a lot of
stuff about yourself

177
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,640
that the insurer doesn't know.

178
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,000
As a result, the information
asymmetry is flipped.

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,942
With insurance, the
insurer is worried

180
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:27,650
that when you come
looking for insurance,

181
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,910
they're worried you're looking
for insurance because you're

182
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,923
sick.

183
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:31,340
You might be looking
for insurance

184
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,919
because you're risk averse
and that's great for insurers.

185
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,039
We talked about insurance, how
there's essentially a game.

186
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,650
I'm willing to pay a risk
premium so insurers can

187
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,002
make money by selling to me.

188
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:43,419
But what if I'm not coming to
you because I'm risk averse?

189
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,669
What if I'm coming to you
because I'm a huge skydiving

190
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:46,190
fan?

191
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,712
And you don't know that.

192
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:49,420
You might be afraid
to sell me insurance,

193
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,890
because you might
lose money on me.

194
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,530
So let's work out another
example to show this.

195
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,560
Imagine you graduate,
and you decide

196
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,290
a great business model
is to offer health

197
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,630
insurance to recent MIT grads.

198
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,270
You say, look, we're a bunch
of kind of careful nerds.

199
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,190
We're likely not
going to go skydiving.

200
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,380
We're just going to sit
at our desks and work.

201
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,870
Maybe there'll be carpal tunnel
risk, but other than that,

202
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,012
we're a pretty safe bunch.

203
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,470
So I'm going to offer health
insurance to recent MIT grads,

204
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,000
because they're a healthy group.

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,020
And let's say suppose that
of every 100 MIT grads,

206
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:31,350
90 are healthy,
and 10 are sickly.

207
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,385
Let's just suppose
you know those facts.

208
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:34,260
You know those facts.

209
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,970
You've collected
the data to know

210
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,970
that on average, of every 100
MIT grads, 90 are healthy,

211
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,750
10 are sickly.

212
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,860
You don't know which are which,
but you know the proportions.

213
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,660
And let's say that
with a healthy person

214
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,930
over the next year,
there's a 10% chance

215
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,850
that they will need--

216
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:05,220
that they will incur a $10,000
charge, and a 90% chance

217
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,510
that they'll have zero costs.

218
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,390
So there's a 10% chance of
a $10,000 cost, 90% chance

219
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,380
they'll have a zero cost.

220
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:23,020
So your expected cost for
insuring this person is $1,000.

221
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:31,460
You expect someone like
that will cost you $1,000.

222
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:37,400
Now suppose for the sickly
guy, there's a 50% chance

223
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,170
that they'll cost you $10 K,
and a 50% chance that they'll

224
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,880
cost you 0.

225
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,210
So your expected costs for
them, the expected costs

226
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,898
for this person, is $5,000.

227
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:54,190
Do people understand the setup?

228
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,840
There's two types.

229
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,040
I know these facts, but
I don't know who's who.

230
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,550
I just know these facts,
because I'm good at math.

231
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,480
I've done all the
actuarial calculations.

232
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,972
Now, if everyone buys in, now
I'm going to set my price.

233
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,430
What am I doing to
do to the price?

234
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,630
I'm going to say, look, if
everyone buys health insurance,

235
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:24,360
then I've got my expected
cost is 0.9 times

236
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,430
1,000 plus 0.1 times 5,000.

237
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,800
My expected cost is
1,400, so I expect

238
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,400
to have to spend $1,400 a year.

239
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,310
In fact, on average,
I'll spend $1,400 a year.

240
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,130
With large enough samples, I can
predict that with certainty--

241
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,810
that if everyone buys insurance,
I'll spend $1,400 a year.

242
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,060
So let's say you're risk
neutral, because you're rich,

243
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,140
and so forth.

244
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,420
This is sort of risk
neutral for you.

245
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,310
So you say, look,
I'll just charge--

246
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:58,330
I'll set a premium of $1,500,
and I'll make $100 per person.

247
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,930
If 100 will buy,
that's $10,000 profit.

248
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,340
That's pretty good.

249
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,540
There are 1,000 kids in
the graduating class.

250
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,850
If 1,000 kids buy, and
I make $100 profit,

251
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,560
then that's $100,000.

252
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,554
That's pretty good
money for a year.

253
00:12:12,554 --> 00:12:19,240
Now, what is wrong
with this calculation?

254
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,590
What, in fact, will happen if
you sell insurance for $1,500?

255
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,290
Yeah.

256
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,540
AUDIENCE: We'll buy insurance.

257
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,802
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well
let's go step by step.

258
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:28,760
What about sick people?

259
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,610
If you sell $1,500,
what will they do?

260
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,590
AUDIENCE: They'll buy.

261
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,673
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes, so
if you set up for $1,500,

262
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:37,150
you are certainly going
to sell to all the sick.

263
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,550
So if you sell
for $1,500, you'll

264
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,030
certainly sell to all the sick.

265
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,110
What about the healthy?

266
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,100
What will determine
whether or not they buy?

267
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,710
Yeah.

268
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,228
AUDIENCE: When the
price is smaller

269
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,590
than the expected amount
they'd have to pay on their own

270
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,307
[INAUDIBLE].

271
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:54,890
JONATHAN GRUBER: Not
quite, not quite.

272
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,015
There's another piece, too.

273
00:12:56,015 --> 00:12:56,690
Don't forget.

274
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,190
What else?

275
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,100
What else?

276
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,080
It's not just the expected cost.

277
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,663
What else?

278
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:01,830
AUDIENCE: The risk aversion.

279
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,350
JONATHAN GRUBER: The risk
aversion-- remember, there's

280
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,320
a risk premium that they'll pay.

281
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,280
So whether that
healthy person will buy

282
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,970
or not, if it's just expected
cost, then they wouldn't buy--

283
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,000
the $1,000 expected
cost, buy the $1,500.

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,190
But some might be
risk averse and buy.

285
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,100
So let's just say half
the guys are risk averse,

286
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,860
and they're willing to pay
$1,500 for $1,000 expected

287
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,320
costs in half are.

288
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,670
So let's say you end up
selling to all the sick

289
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,980
and half the healthy.

290
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,900
So how much money do you make?

291
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:35,220
Well, you sell the 60
people at $1,500 each,

292
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,040
so your revenues are $75,000.

293
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,940
You sell to 50 healthy and
10 sick, $75,000 revenues.

294
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,870
What are your costs?

295
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,600
Your costs are-- you have
10 people that are cost you

296
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,470
$5,000, so it's
$50,000, plus 50 people

297
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,920
who are going to cost you
$1,000, plus another $50,000

298
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,660
equals $100,000.

299
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,910
And you've lost money.

300
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,090
You priced at above the
expected total, and lost money.

301
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,190
Why did you lose money?

302
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,170
You lost money because of the
problem of adverse selection--

303
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,320
the problem of we call
"adverse selection."

304
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,300
Adverse selection
is the problem that,

305
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,730
due to information asymmetries,
only the worse risks

306
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,680
will participate in the market.

307
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,720
And that will cause people
selling in the market

308
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,180
to lose money, or
likewise here, the concern

309
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,970
is that only the worst cars
will participate in the market.

310
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,220
And so if people buy
cars, we'll be worse off.

311
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,720
Yeah.

312
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,457
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
you make $90,000?

313
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:54,290
JONATHAN GRUBER: No.

314
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,720
You sell to-- you sell $1,500
each, and you sell to--

315
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,470
yes, you're right.

316
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,510
You make $90,000, my bad.

317
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,240
Yes, $1,500 each times
60 people is $90,000.

318
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,190
You still lose money,
but not as much.

319
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,110
Right.

320
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,410
Now, you might say, look,
you're not losing that much.

321
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,640
Your solution-- just
raise the price.

322
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,080
What if you said, fine,
let's just raise the price,

323
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,460
and let's charge
$2,000 a person.

324
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,920
Then that would cover,
because $2,000 a person,

325
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,000
60 will make $120,000,
the costs are $100,000.

326
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,620
You'd be golden, right?

327
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,295
Yeah.

328
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:34,600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

329
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,350
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Who would you lose?

330
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,070
AUDIENCE: The healthy.

331
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,320
JONATHAN GRUBER: Not the sick.

332
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,860
The sick are
delighted by $10,000.

333
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,860
But once you raise the price,
more healthy people drop out,

334
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,760
because it's higher
than their risk premium.

335
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,427
So what happens is
by raising the price,

336
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:48,218
you're not necessarily
going to make money.

337
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:50,210
It depends on how many
healthy people drop out.

338
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:57,173
So for example, imagine
that you raise it to $2,000,

339
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,090
but now the number of
healthy people that buys

340
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,030
drops to 20 from 50.

341
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,170
Then you lose money again.

342
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,835
So the point is,
you can't actually

343
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:07,710
solve this problem just
by raising the price,

344
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,230
because there's this what
we call "death spiral."

345
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,350
This is a term called
"death spiral," which

346
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,840
is as you raise the
price, you chase out

347
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,640
the healthier
people, which means

348
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,110
you have to raise
the price more,

349
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,480
which shakes out even
more healthy people.

350
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,980
And you end up in
this death spiral.

351
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,810
So that is the problem
of adverse selection.

352
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,160
And that leads you to say,
you know what, I'm not

353
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,110
going to offer this product.

354
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,030
I can't make money
on it, because if I

355
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,977
set the price, whatever price
I set, I'm going to lose money.

356
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:44,560
So I'm not going to
offer the product.

357
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,770
Therefore, the
market has failed.

358
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,570
A market that might
have existed--

359
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,973
on average, this was a market
that made people better off,

360
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:54,390
but the market that might have
existed doesn't does exist.

361
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,394
Yeah.

362
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,830
AUDIENCE: With the death
spiral, wouldn't it

363
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,980
converge like something
equivalent [INAUDIBLE]

364
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:08,603
market forecasting is
[INAUDIBLE] still [INAUDIBLE]..

365
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,770
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right, so
if you leave this alone--

366
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,190
it's an excellent point--

367
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,766
what should the
new equilibrium be?

368
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,599
The price now should
potentially have chased

369
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,869
all the healthy people out.

370
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,805
And then you price,
but you'd have

371
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:20,930
to price it, then, at what?

372
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,097
AUDIENCE: $5,000 [INAUDIBLE]

373
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:23,770
JONATHAN GRUBER:
$5,000 plus something.

374
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,839
So as long as sick
people are risk averse,

375
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,180
you could still make money.

376
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,480
You could still make money
if you sold, say, $5,500

377
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,130
with even modest risk aversion.

378
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,141
Why is that still
a market failure?

379
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:39,968
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

380
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:42,510
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because there's
all these healthy people who

381
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,000
now can't get health insurance.

382
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,062
So yes, it doesn't mean
the market collapse--

383
00:17:47,062 --> 00:17:48,520
market failures
doesn't necessarily

384
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,520
mean market collapse.

385
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,770
It means a reduction in
welfare, because transactions

386
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,140
that might make some people
better off aren't happening.

387
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,270
Here, you might be
able to offer insurance

388
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,470
for healthy people that
makes them better off,

389
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,220
but you're not.

390
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,000
You're only offering
insurance for the sick.

391
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,400
So it's a market failure,
because healthy people

392
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,970
who might want the insurance end
up being kept out of the market

393
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,710
by adverse selection.

394
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,450
Questions about that?

395
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,460
And that is the
fundamental market failure

396
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,700
we face in insurance markets.

397
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,090
That's why we think private
insurance markets will not

398
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,290
function well.

399
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,690
Because private
insurers-- in some sense

400
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,150
the fundamental
problem is that you're

401
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,810
setting one price for
multiple products.

402
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,690
A great case of
adverse selection

403
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,830
is going to buy fruit
at the beginning

404
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,650
versus the end of the day.

405
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,090
What's the difference?

406
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,978
Buy fruit at the beginning
or the end of the day?

407
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:43,770
You guys probably don't
buy a lot of fruit,

408
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,550
but try to think about it.

409
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,225
Yeah.

410
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,965
AUDIENCE: Normally, better is
at the beginning of the day.

411
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:47,400
Then you have--

412
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,390
JONATHAN GRUBER: And
at the end of the day,

413
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,840
in particular, what's left?

414
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,715
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

415
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:52,257
JONATHAN GRUBER:
All the shitty fruit

416
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,800
is left, because
you set one price.

417
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,000
You didn't say good apples
$1.80, shitty apples $1.40.

418
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,420
You said apples, $1.70.

419
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,220
So people come, and
they buy apples.

420
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,552
They go and they feel it.

421
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:03,260
They feel around.

422
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,260
They find the good ones.

423
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,790
The ones that left are crap.

424
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,070
And that is the adverse
selection problem.

425
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,090
Now, with apples, the
market still exists.

426
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,750
Why?

427
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,050
Because they charge so much they
can live with a few bad apples

428
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,490
being at the bottom,
so to speak--

429
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,560
a few bad apples
being at the bottom.

430
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,310
With health insurance,
if I get one bad risk--

431
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,860
someone, say, who's
really, really sick

432
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,300
and costs $1, million--

433
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,750
I go out of business.

434
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,770
So adverse selection
may not destroy markets.

435
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,010
It doesn't destroy
the apple market,

436
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,110
but it can destroy or
significantly impede

437
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,840
insurance markets.

438
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,480
Questions about that?

439
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,020
Yeah.

440
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,240
Manny.

441
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,198
AUDIENCE: Is there some
way insurance companies

442
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:50,155
that hassle hospitals, like
lower the prices or they give

443
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,530
them better
discounts so they can

444
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,430
increase the price of people--

445
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,350
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's a separate issue.

446
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,400
We'll talk about
that next lecture

447
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,300
when we talk about health care.

448
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,340
So that's separate, about
the cost of health care.

449
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,090
This is the reason why
insurance companies

450
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,230
make you fill out a lot
of forms before you go in.

451
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,660
So it's for this reason--

452
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,958
insurance companies are not
powerless against this problem.

453
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,250
They could try to collect as
much information about you

454
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,540
as they can.

455
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,530
As I get more and
more [INAUDIBLE]

456
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,860
can learn more and more
who's healthy, who's sick,

457
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,110
then I can solve this problem.

458
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,582
AUDIENCE: So your
familiar with those

459
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:26,790
home kits that [INAUDIBLE]
and 23andme will send you.

460
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,050
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, 23andme.

461
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:29,925
Yeah.

462
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:34,290
AUDIENCE: So is it
possible that at some point

463
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,390
in the foreseeable
future, those are going

464
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,938
to become part of [INAUDIBLE]?

465
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,580
Those are going to become part
of how insurance is determined,

466
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,340
like if it's in your DNA,
get some condition when

467
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,840
you get old that we can say you
have a preexisting condition

468
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,360
now that hasn't manifested yet?

469
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,110
JONATHAN GRUBER: So
this is a great point.

470
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,735
I was going to talk
about it next time.

471
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,790
I'll talk about it now,
which is in some sense,

472
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,850
we are eventually
moving to a point

473
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,960
where there'll be no
adverse selection.

474
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,710
Now you might say, on
the one hand, that's

475
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,330
because ultimately, we'll
know everything about you

476
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,950
from the moment you're born.

477
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,180
We know your genes.

478
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,700
We won't know if you're a
skydiver, but we'll know--

479
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,210
we'll probably know genes
that determine risk taking.

480
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,100
And we'll charge more for
people who like taking risks.

481
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:23,580
So the good news is that then,
I can make the market work.

482
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,854
The bad news is in that world,
how would I set my insurance?

483
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,625
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

484
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,000
JONATHAN GRUBER:
I would charge--

485
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,458
because what I
would do is I'd say,

486
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,340
your genes say you're healthy,
so I want $1,100 from you.

487
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,040
Your genes say you're sick,
so I want $6,000 from you.

488
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,050
So essentially, insurance
wouldn't exist anymore.

489
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,050
There'd be no insurance.

490
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,310
What is insurance?

491
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,310
Insurance is pooling people
with different probabilities

492
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,430
of adverse events, and letting
us all benefit from the fact

493
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,920
that if it happens to us,
at least we're protected.

494
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,170
Well, if you charge
me my expected cost,

495
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,993
I'm no longer protected.

496
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:02,160
So here's the example that
makes it perfectly clear,

497
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,330
one of the most famous examples.

498
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,913
Ken Arrow was one of the great
economists of the 20th century,

499
00:22:05,913 --> 00:22:06,960
died recently.

500
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,442
He had his famous
islands example.

501
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:10,650
Ken Arrow's island example
is the following-- imagine

502
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,300
there's two islands somewhere
in the South Pacific

503
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,870
that are very small, that's
got one farmer on each.

504
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,760
And the farmers know
a hurricane is coming

505
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
and it's going to wipe
out one of their islands,

506
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,710
but they don't know which.

507
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,663
They just know one's
getting wiped out.

508
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:25,830
What will they naturally do?

509
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,020
They'll naturally get
together and say, look,

510
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,270
islands get wiped out, but
let's insure each other.

511
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,180
If I get wiped out, you give
me a bunch of your crop.

512
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,472
If you get wiped out, I'll
give you a bunch of my crop.

513
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:36,120
That will improve
both our welfare,

514
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,590
because getting wiped
out is going to zero.

515
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,090
You die.

516
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,600
That's a terrible outcome.

517
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,810
So that will improve our
welfare if we insure each other.

518
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,480
Now let's say a weather service
comes along, and provides

519
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,497
information, and
tells you that farmer

520
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:49,830
A's island is getting wiped
out and farmer B's island is

521
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,530
going to be fine.

522
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,020
What has happened to welfare?

523
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,650
It's gotten worse.

524
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,267
Why?

525
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:57,892
Because farmer A goes
to farmer B, says

526
00:22:57,892 --> 00:22:59,517
it turns out I'm
going to be wiped out.

527
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:00,760
Farmer B says, well, see you.

528
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,130
I'm just going to keep
consuming my high level.

529
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,950
Farmer B is somewhat better off.

530
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,850
Farmer A is dead.

531
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,850
Total social welfare has
fallen because the concavity,

532
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,830
because diminishing
market utility.

533
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:16,280
More information
has made us worse.

534
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,773
We say more is
better in economics.

535
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:19,940
Once you get into topics
like, this you realize more

536
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,090
is not always better.

537
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,370
More is worse.

538
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,560
More information has
destroyed the insurance market

539
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,220
that might function.

540
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,370
So in fact, this issue
I'm talking about

541
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,010
is becoming paramount
as we move more and more

542
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,585
towards perfect
information environment.

543
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:35,960
So the kind of government
policies I'm talking about next

544
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,368
become critical as you move
towards that environment.

545
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:40,910
But first, I want
to make sure we all

546
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,100
understand why the
private markets failed,

547
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,040
why it's a failure.

548
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,810
Now, what can the
government do about this?

549
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,710
What are some potential
government solutions?

550
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,210
And we've tried all of these
in the US and around the world.

551
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,585
Let's talk about
three categories

552
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:57,150
of government solutions.

553
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,780
The first is subsidization.

554
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,090
The government could
subsidize the purchase

555
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,290
of health insurance.

556
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,500
So for example, what if
the US government said

557
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,730
to all the MIT grads, I'm
going to give you a $400

558
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,750
tax credit that you could have--

559
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,953
or $500 tax credit if
you buy health insurance.

560
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:24,370
Well, if there's
a $500 tax credit

561
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,410
if I buy health insurance,
and I charge $1,500,

562
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,730
then what's the effective
price now to the healthy guy?

563
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,647
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

564
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:33,192
JONATHAN GRUBER:
$1,000, so he buys.

565
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:34,984
Even if he's risk
neutral, he buys, as long

566
00:24:34,984 --> 00:24:36,950
as he's a tiny bit risk averse.

567
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,250
So I do sell to everyone.

568
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,332
I make my money.

569
00:24:40,332 --> 00:24:41,790
So one way to solve
this problem is

570
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,970
to basically pay the healthy
people to get into the market.

571
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,260
They can't just give money
to the healthy people.

572
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,370
You've got to give
it to everyone,

573
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,170
because you can't
tell who's healthy.

574
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,050
But if we give
everyone a tax credit,

575
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,210
then we could bring
everyone to the market

576
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,020
and solve this problem.

577
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,170
Well, in fact, we
do this in America.

578
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,230
It's actually perhaps the
largest hidden government

579
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,700
expenditure in
our country, which

580
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:12,510
is the tax subsidy to
employer-sponsored insurance,

581
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,338
employer health insurance.

582
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,700
The tax subsidy on
employer health insurance--

583
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,880
what do I mean by that?

584
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,530
What I mean is the following--
when MIT pays me in wages,

585
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,810
I am taxed on that, like
the taxation we talked

586
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,810
about a couple lectures ago.

587
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,940
When MIT pays me in
health insurance,

588
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,092
I am not taxed on that.

589
00:25:33,092 --> 00:25:34,050
So what does that mean?

590
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,425
If MIT comes to
me, and they say,

591
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:39,050
would you like $1,000 raise
or $1,000 orthodontic benefits

592
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,370
for your daughter?

593
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,560
I say, well, $1,000 raise
in today's tax rates,

594
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,432
I'm going to take
home about $550.

595
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:45,890
If you add up all
the tax I'll pay,

596
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,942
then I'll take home about $550.

597
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:50,900
$1,000 of orthodontic
benefits for my daughter,

598
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,430
I get the whole $1,000.

599
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,015
So why not?

600
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:54,140
So I got these cool braces.

601
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,310
They spin and change color.

602
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,852
And every two weeks, she's in
for a different kind of braces.

603
00:25:57,852 --> 00:26:00,480
It's great, because it's free.

604
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,440
So we do subsidize health
insurance in America.

605
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,145
And this amounts
to-- this program

606
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:10,230
that I just talked about
amounts to almost $300 billion

607
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,580
per year.

608
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,370
We spend almost $300
billion per year

609
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:19,050
giving a tax break to people
to buy health insurance.

610
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,390
So that's one tactic
we take to try

611
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,030
to solve this problem to get
healthy people into the market.

612
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,450
That's approach one.

613
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,240
A second approach one can
use to try to get people

614
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,130
into the market is a mandate.

615
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,120
Suppose I just pass a
law that says everyone

616
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,010
has to buy health insurance.

617
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,080
Then I've solved the problem.

618
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,500
I know what my expected costs
are if everyone has to buy.

619
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,240
I know my expected
costs are $1,400,

620
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,970
so I know I can make
money at $1,500.

621
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,230
That's easier at one level.

622
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,550
I don't have to spend--

623
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,800
$30 billion is a lot of money.

624
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,872
This cost me $0.

625
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,080
It's harder on another level.

626
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,830
Why?

627
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,760
What's the problem
with that solution?

628
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,847
Yeah.

629
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:02,722
AUDIENCE: Not having
the money for insurance.

630
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:03,190
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

631
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,150
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
it may not have it.

632
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:05,750
That's right.

633
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,160
What else?

634
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,680
Yeah.

635
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,750
AUDIENCE: He may not want it.

636
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,208
JONATHAN GRUBER: The healthy
people are going to be pissed.

637
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:13,280
They're like, look,
if I had chosen not--

638
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,720
you're going to basically--

639
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,640
the mandate only
has an effect if it

640
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,060
changes people's behavior.

641
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,100
But changing people's
behavior means

642
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,600
you're making them
do something they

643
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,130
didn't want to do beforehand.

644
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,940
So the problem with that
the problem with this is you

645
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,980
spend a lot of money.

646
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,030
The problem this is you
piss off healthy people.

647
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,030
The third approach we could do--

648
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,880
there's lots of
examples of a mandate.

649
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,150
Obviously, we know about
the health insurance

650
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,370
mandate that was originally
part of Obamacare.

651
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,050
But that's not the
biggest example.

652
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,970
The biggest example
in the US is what's

653
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,380
called "Workers' Comp
Insurance," which is insurance

654
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,750
that you have for
on-the-job injuries.

655
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,020
If you get hurt at work, your
employer pays money so that you

656
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,193
get reimbursed when you're--

657
00:27:55,193 --> 00:27:57,360
it pays your medical bills
when you get hurt at work

658
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,400
and gives you partial
replacement of your wages.

659
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,770
That is mandated
insurance on all employers

660
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,830
in America, except in Texas.

661
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,880
Texas, they can choose.

662
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,791
Every other state,
it's mandated.

663
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,168
Mandated insurance for
every employer in America.

664
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:12,460
They have to buy Workers' Comp.

665
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,543
So we've examples of that.

666
00:28:13,543 --> 00:28:15,700
And that's an $80
billion a year program.

667
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,660
That's a big deal.

668
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,560
Finally, we can just
provide the insurance.

669
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,000
That's actually the most
common thing we do in America.

670
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,240
Social Security is our program
that provides insurance

671
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,560
for the elderly, for the costs
for survival after retirement.

672
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,150
Medicare is insurance for
the elderly we provide.

673
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,280
Unemployment
insurance is insurance

674
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,470
we provide against
losing your job.

675
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,840
Disability insurance
is insurance

676
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,840
we provide against having
a career-ending disability.

677
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,590
So this is actually
the most common thing.

678
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,180
Indeed, provision of
social insurance in America

679
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,380
costs almost--

680
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,210
costs more than
private insurance.

681
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,710
So we spend about a trillion
and a half on private insurance

682
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,730
in America.

683
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,340
Social insurance is probably
about $1.7 to $2 trillion,

684
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,710
depending how you measure it.

685
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,410
So actually, this
is the biggest thing

686
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:14,320
we do is we just
provide insurance,

687
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,300
and that is a very
large solution.

688
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,570
Now once again, what's
the problem with this?

689
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,310
You don't make the
healthy people unhappy,

690
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,240
because everyone, you
just give it to them.

691
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,580
The problem is you have
to spend money on this.

692
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,760
This is $1.7 trillion in taxes
we've got to raise every year.

693
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,460
That's non-trivial.

694
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,230
So basically, each
of these solutions

695
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,570
has potential problems.

696
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,540
So the adverse selection problem
will cause the private market

697
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,540
to fail.

698
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,350
There are potential
government solutions,

699
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,470
but they each have limitations.

700
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,840
This one's pretty expensive,
this one's super expensive,

701
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,730
this one pisses
off healthy people.

702
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,595
Now, you'll note the middle one,
the pissed-off healthy people

703
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:54,640
is kind of subtle.

704
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,515
You don't see a lot of
healthy people railing

705
00:29:56,515 --> 00:29:58,310
against mandated
[INAUDIBLE] Workers' Comp

706
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,435
like they did against the
health insurance mandate,

707
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:01,830
because people don't know.

708
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,320
So in some sense, this
one's a little bit subtle,

709
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,690
because people have to know.

710
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,942
Basically, it's sort
of crazy that I'm

711
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:10,900
paying tax that I'm never
getting hurt at work.

712
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,810
Am I going to have--

713
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,718
what am I going to do, like
slip at my desk or something?

714
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:17,260
Never going to get hurt at work,
but I pay taxes all the time

715
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,860
just in case someone
else at MIT gets hurt.

716
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,590
Some of the janitorial staff
has a risk of being hurt.

717
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,290
I'm paying taxes in case
the janitor gets hurt.

718
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,620
I should be upset about
that, but I'm not.

719
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,810
And in some sense, it's
about what people know,

720
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,910
what they don't.

721
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:38,150
So that is the basic argument
for social insurance.

722
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,830
But when we provide
social insurance

723
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,380
despite all these
problems, we enter

724
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,770
into a fundamental
trade-off, which

725
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,208
is, let's decide
we've determined

726
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,500
some optimal government policy.

727
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,300
Let's decide that
the markets failed,

728
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,640
so we're going to do
one of these things

729
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,223
or are some combination of these
things and solve the problem.

730
00:30:54,223 --> 00:30:59,570
The problem is that when
you insure people for risks

731
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,350
you create a new problem
called "moral hazard."

732
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:15,570
Moral hazard is basically
the adverse behavior that

733
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,950
is encouraged by insurance.

734
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:24,180
When you insure people, you
encourage adverse behavior.

735
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,480
So the classic
example of this is--

736
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,510
if I have health insurance, I
ride my bike less carefully,

737
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,870
because if I get in a crash--

738
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,970
I'm not crazy.

739
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,020
I certainly don't want
to get in a crash,

740
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,130
but I'm a little
bit less careful

741
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,470
because I know I'm insured
in case I get in a crash.

742
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,380
If I have fire insurance, I
don't buy a fire extinguisher

743
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,270
for my house, because
if it burns down,

744
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,580
I'm just going to get
the money back anyway.

745
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,880
Or if workers have insurance
against losing a job that

746
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,340
pays them when out of work,
they might search less hard

747
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,320
for a new job.

748
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,570
Basically, if I lose my
job and I got nothing,

749
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,930
I'm going to work my ass
off to get a new job.

750
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,388
If I lose my job
and the government

751
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:59,212
says, well, for 26 weeks,
we'll give you half your salary

752
00:31:59,212 --> 00:32:01,670
while you look for a job, I'll
be a little bit less rushed.

753
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,530
And there's lots of evidence
that moral hazard is a problem.

754
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,220
I comes with two
types of evidence.

755
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,060
The first type evidence
is fun anecdotes.

756
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,380
So the great effect that--
workers' compensation, let's

757
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:14,880
take that.

758
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,255
Workers' compensation, it's
a program [INAUDIBLE] needed.

759
00:32:17,255 --> 00:32:18,630
Lots of people get hurt at work.

760
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,925
I don't, but lots of
people do get hurt at work.

761
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:23,920
And so it's a sensible
social insurance program.

762
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,460
The problem is it has a
huge moral hazard component.

763
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,200
And there's fun
examples of this,

764
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,410
like the prison guard
in Massachusetts

765
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,270
who claimed he got
hurt on the job,

766
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,870
collected $82,000 in benefits,
while the whole time running

767
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,842
a karate school and
teaching students karate.

768
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:40,800
And finally someone
noticed online this guy who

769
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,900
couldn't work was
running a karate school

770
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,090
and doing karate kicks
and stuff online.

771
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,520
So there's all sorts of
fun examples about that.

772
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,960
But more convincing
for economists

773
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,970
is statistical evidence.

774
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,070
And the statistical
evidence is clear

775
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,160
that moral hazard
is a big problem.

776
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,090
For example, if you raise
the benefits people get

777
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,135
under workers' comp, suddenly
they become injured more often

778
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:03,800
and stay out of work longer.

779
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,530
There's no reason-- injuries
should be because you got hurt.

780
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,030
So how can it be
that suddenly, when

781
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,613
a state raises its
benefits, suddenly,

782
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,580
there's more injuries?

783
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,760
The answer is moral hazard.

784
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,800
When states raise their
unemployment insurance

785
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,350
benefits, more people
leave their jobs and they

786
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,260
stay unemployed longer--

787
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,300
moral hazard.

788
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,060
So the moral hazard
problem is real.

789
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,263
It's an inherent trade-off,
actually not just

790
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:27,180
with public insurance.

791
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,160
Private insurance,
too-- anytime you

792
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,558
insure people and
something bad happens,

793
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:33,100
you're providing
less of an incentive

794
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:38,740
for them to try themselves to
avoid that bad thing happening.

795
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,390
So moral hazard
is a real problem

796
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,060
and it's essentially
the trade-off.

797
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,087
On the one hand, we talked
about why people like insurance.

798
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:49,420
We talked about why people
like private insurers because

799
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,290
of risk aversion.

800
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,510
We talked about why government
intervention insurance

801
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,130
in markets is necessary.

802
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,080
But that comes with
the trade-off, which

803
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,450
is the more insurance
you provide,

804
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,130
the less people take
care of themselves.

805
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,290
And that's the trade-off.

806
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,090
Now, why do we care?

807
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,590
Let's just sit back and say,
that's an interesting economics

808
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,715
concept, but why do I care?

809
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,489
Why do I care if someone stays
out of work longer, fakes

810
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,920
an injury, or whatever?

811
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,300
Why do I care about this?

812
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,790
Why is this a problem?

813
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,960
It's a problem for two reasons.

814
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,650
There's two costs
to moral hazard.

815
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:31,981
The first cost to moral
hazard is lower efficiency.

816
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,540
And the best way
to see this is just

817
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,239
to think about the economics
of the consumption/leisure

818
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,960
trade-off.

819
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,630
Think about how I make my
decision of how hard to work.

820
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,050
Basically, if there's no
insurance, no social insurance,

821
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,790
no workers' comp, no
unemployment insurance,

822
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,410
how do I choose
how hard to work?

823
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,350
How do I choose
how hard to work?

824
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,150
How do I do that?

825
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,050
What's the trade-off I consider
in deciding how hard to work?

826
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:08,543
Yeah.

827
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:09,450
AUDIENCE: Consumption
versus leisure.

828
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,283
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Consumption versus leisure,

829
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:14,220
in particular, I
will trade them off

830
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,440
until the marginal value of
the next hour of leisure--

831
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,870
marginal value of leisure--

832
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,750
equals the wage.

833
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,620
Because the marginal value
of leisure is above the wage,

834
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,620
I should work less hard.

835
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,630
That means I'd
rather be at home.

836
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,757
If the marginal value of
leisure is below the wage,

837
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:31,590
that means I'm just
wasting my time at home.

838
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,243
I should work harder.

839
00:35:33,243 --> 00:35:35,160
So I'll continue to trade
off work and leisure

840
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,050
till the next hour
of leisure makes

841
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,590
me just as happy as the
next hour of working.

842
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,330
And that is the
efficient outcome.

843
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,010
That is the socially
efficient outcome,

844
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,050
because leisure is
not a social bad.

845
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,540
There's nothing
wrong with leisure.

846
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,100
People value leisure.

847
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,290
They should get to trade
off the leisure versus what

848
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,623
they get from working till
they choose the right amount.

849
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:57,930
That's what makes
society best off.

850
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,370
Now, what happens if I
say, if you sit at home,

851
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,460
you're also going to get a
check from the government?

852
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,530
Now, what's my new equation?

853
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,370
Now, if I work, I
still get the wage.

854
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,110
But what happens
if I sit at home?

855
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:17,100
I get the marginal value of
leisure plus the government

856
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,770
check.

857
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,538
So now I sit at home until
this equation is true,

858
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:26,830
which means that I sit at
home until the marginal value

859
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:31,310
of leisure equals the wage
minus the government transfer.

860
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,810
That means the marginal
value of leisure

861
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,980
will be lower than it would
be without the government

862
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,600
transfer, which
means I work what?

863
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,490
More hard or less hard?

864
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,157
If the marginal value of
leisure is forced down,

865
00:36:47,157 --> 00:36:48,240
that means I'm doing what?

866
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:52,666
Someone raised their hand.

867
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:52,893
Yeah.

868
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:53,600
AUDIENCE: More leisure.

869
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,250
JONATHAN GRUBER: More
leisure, because remember,

870
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,292
there's diminishing marginal
value of everything,

871
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:00,050
so I'm taking more
leisure, less work.

872
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,450
So the government is
causing me to work less

873
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,790
by essentially saying,
look, I'm going to reward

874
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,830
you more for staying at home.

875
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,120
What does that do?

876
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,050
That means that people work
less than is socially optimal.

877
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,990
This is the social optimum.

878
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,210
This means people are
taking more leisure

879
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,760
and working less than
is socially optimal.

880
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,910
When people work less, that
shifts in the supply curve

881
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,590
and creates a deadweight loss.

882
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,040
Social welfare has fallen.

883
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,260
Let me remind you, it's
not falling because people

884
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,090
take some time off.

885
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,580
Many people on the conservative
side of the spectrum

886
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,620
will act as if work is a virtue.

887
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,380
Work is not a virtue.

888
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,432
The optimal solution is to work
until your value of working

889
00:37:44,432 --> 00:37:45,640
equals your value of leisure.

890
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,520
If you're someone who
has a job that you hate

891
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,590
and doesn't pay well,
and you love watching TV,

892
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,660
you should work less.

893
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,270
That's what's
optimal for society.

894
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,360
But you shouldn't work even
less because the government's

895
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,150
paying you to stay home.

896
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,530
That reduces efficiency.

897
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,238
So that's a problem of moral
hazard is it lowers efficiency.

898
00:38:05,238 --> 00:38:06,780
There is a second
problem, of course,

899
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,840
of moral hazard, which
is if you work less,

900
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,140
then we have to tax people
who do work more to pay

901
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,590
for these programs.

902
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:21,260
So it raises taxation, raises
the required tax revenues,

903
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,380
raises the tax
revenues required.

904
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,290
Because if you're
sitting at home more,

905
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,020
I've got to make more money
to pay for you to sit at home.

906
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,220
And we know taxation also
causes deadweight loss.

907
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,230
So it's a double win.

908
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,157
I cause you to
stay at home and I

909
00:38:35,157 --> 00:38:37,615
cause other people to have to
pay more taxes to pay for you

910
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,630
to sit at home, which causes
them to work less, too.

911
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,170
There's a second round effect.

912
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,680
As a result, moral hazard
causes inefficiency in society.

913
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,090
And that is the trade-off.

914
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,090
Once again, I told you,
this course is annoying.

915
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,423
We don't give you right answers.

916
00:38:53,423 --> 00:38:54,830
We just tell you trade-offs.

917
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:59,300
The trade-off here is we need
programs like unemployment

918
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,133
insurance, because otherwise--

919
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,050
let's take the case of
unemployment insurance.

920
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,467
We'll go through
it one more time.

921
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,710
Imagine there's no government
unemployment insurance,

922
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,835
and you said, that's great.

923
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:10,010
I'll offer private
unemployment insurance.

924
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,610
Well, that's not going to work.

925
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,200
Why?

926
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,610
Because people
know way more than

927
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:16,270
you do about whether they're
going to lose their job.

928
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,370
If you tried to offer
private insurance,

929
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:21,690
you'd lose your shirt
because of adverse selection.

930
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,050
So absent government-provided
unemployment insurance,

931
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,758
there would be no
unemployment insurance.

932
00:39:25,758 --> 00:39:26,880
And that would be bad.

933
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,850
That would mean people would
be subject to a risk that

934
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,433
would drive their
consumption to zero.

935
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:32,677
Remember, most Americans
have no savings.

936
00:39:32,677 --> 00:39:34,510
That mean Americans
would be subject to risk

937
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,580
where if they lost their
job, they would starve.

938
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,570
That's a very bad outcome.

939
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,380
So it is socially
valuable to insure

940
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,460
against unemployment risk.

941
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,240
The private market can't do it
because of adverse selection.

942
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,660
Therefore, there is a
compelling case for government

943
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,370
unemployment insurance.

944
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,595
But with government-provided
unemployment insurance,

945
00:39:55,595 --> 00:39:57,220
that causes people
to sit at home extra

946
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,710
and not work as hard.

947
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,800
And that's the sort
of chain of logic

948
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,430
which teaches you the trade-off.

949
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,190
What this says is optimal
social insurance--

950
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,940
that in these
markets, we're going

951
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:12,270
to want some social
insurance, but not too much.

952
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,210
We're going to want
enough to protect people

953
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,702
against starving, but
not so much that it

954
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:17,910
causes people to sit at home.

955
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,487
So for example,
if I told you I'm

956
00:40:19,487 --> 00:40:21,570
going to set up an
unemployment insurance program,

957
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,170
and the way it's going to
work is if you lose your job,

958
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,900
I'm going to pay your
entire wage for as long

959
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,380
as you need until you find
a new job, that would not

960
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,650
be a good idea.

961
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,990
That would cause a huge
amount of moral hazard.

962
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,080
And remember, compare
that program to one

963
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,340
where I'll pay you 50% of your
wage till you find a new job.

964
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:46,183
Well, 50%, going
from 0% to 50%, 0%

965
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:48,850
of your wage to 50% of your wage
is a huge consumption smoothing

966
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,350
benefit.

967
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,550
You go from starving to
being able to eat decently.

968
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,640
50% to 100% is an
increase, but not as much.

969
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,803
But 50% to 100% has a
huge moral hazard effect.

970
00:40:57,803 --> 00:40:59,720
So you want something
more towards the middle,

971
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,030
where you're getting people
away from starving, but not

972
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,450
so much that they don't work.

973
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,710
So that's the trade-off.

974
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,480
So let's talk about
that trade in practice.

975
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,230
Let's talk about the US
Social Security program.

976
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,900
The Social Security
program in the US--

977
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,590
Social Security is our biggest
single social insurance program

978
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,970
in the US.

979
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:31,310
Currently, the Social Security
program is about $800 billion

980
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,420
per year.

981
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,300
That's real money.

982
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,640
That's even more than Jeff
Bezos has, $800 billion a year.

983
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,537
That's more than he's
worth, every year.

984
00:41:41,537 --> 00:41:42,620
What does this program do?

985
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,230
What this program
does, in a nutshell,

986
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:50,000
is it insures you against
the income loss you're

987
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,790
going to face when you retire.

988
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,830
When people retire,
they suddenly

989
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,510
go from having a lot of
income to having no income.

990
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,260
And basically, the
idea of Social Security

991
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,060
is to make sure you don't
starve when you're old.

992
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,090
So the way it works
is you pay a tax.

993
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,700
And if you ever see a line on
your pay stub that says FICA,

994
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,200
that's what this is for.

995
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,400
You pay a FICA tax.

996
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,563
It is 12.4% of payroll, half
on you, half on your employer.

997
00:42:16,563 --> 00:42:18,730
But it doesn't matter that
half is on your employer,

998
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,647
because we learned two
lectures ago it doesn't

999
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:22,300
matter who pays the tax.

1000
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,850
It's a 12.4% tax.

1001
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:27,010
That's what matters on you.

1002
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,500
That money then
provides that when

1003
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,920
you retire, starting at
age 62, you get a check

1004
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,060
from the government.

1005
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,890
And you get a check
from the government

1006
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,288
that lasts until you die.

1007
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,830
The check from the
government you get

1008
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:41,470
is what's called an "annuity."

1009
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,670
An annuity is a payment.

1010
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,080
Annuities are the opposite
of life insurance.

1011
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,890
Life insurance is money that
your family gets when you die.

1012
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:51,890
Annuity is a regular payment
you get until you die.

1013
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,500
The way it works, you pay 12
and 1/2 percent of your income

1014
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,750
all the way through your
working life till we turn 62,

1015
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,300
or you can collect it later.

1016
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,870
You then get a payment
for the rest of your life.

1017
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:07,310
That payment is
typically about half

1018
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,540
of what you made when
you were working,

1019
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,930
but it's very
progressive, in the sense

1020
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,305
that for someone
who's very poor,

1021
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:19,430
it would probably more than
half of what they made.

1022
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,097
For someone who's
rich, it would be much

1023
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:22,420
less than half what they made.

1024
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,710
It's a progressive payment.

1025
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,910
Everyone gets it.

1026
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:26,320
Everyone gets Social Security.

1027
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,570
But how much you get from
it depends on your income.

1028
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:30,112
The poorer you are,
the more generous

1029
00:43:30,112 --> 00:43:34,260
it is relatively
when you retire.

1030
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,170
Now the-- yeah.

1031
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,402
AUDIENCE: Is it possible as
life expectancies get larger,

1032
00:43:39,402 --> 00:43:42,923
it's going to be harder
to have Social Security

1033
00:43:42,923 --> 00:43:44,090
because if you're going to--

1034
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,440
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's a huge problem.

1035
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,900
It sounds like you should
definitely be enrolled in 1441.

1036
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,190
That's a whole half a
lecture we spend on that.

1037
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,357
I don't have time to talk
about it here, but clearly

1038
00:43:52,357 --> 00:43:53,510
this is a huge, huge--

1039
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,250
so just to give you
a couple numbers just

1040
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,430
to keep you up at night.

1041
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,430
We all know, we're all
talking about the deficit

1042
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,370
is $500 billion.

1043
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,590
It's a big deal.

1044
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,400
If you ask how much
has America promised

1045
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,960
to pay to our senior citizens
over the foreseeable future

1046
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,060
minus how much we'll
collected taxes,

1047
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,880
we are currently, as a
nation, $75 trillion in debt.

1048
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,880
And it's because of the aging
society and things like that.

1049
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,713
We've got big problems
coming down the road.

1050
00:44:19,713 --> 00:44:21,440
We can talk about
that another time.

1051
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,900
But let's focus on the program
itself at a point in time

1052
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,150
right now.

1053
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:30,020
So basically, we see here
the moral hazard trade-off.

1054
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,850
On the one hand, we
don't want people

1055
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,230
to starve when they're old.

1056
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,840
On the other hand, if I pay
you once you're retired,

1057
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,180
that could cause you to retire.

1058
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,190
If I say, once
you're retired you're

1059
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:42,485
going to get a check, 50%
of your wage, you might say,

1060
00:44:42,485 --> 00:44:44,360
50% of the wage isn't
that much, but I really

1061
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,152
don't like working.

1062
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:48,860
I'd rather just hit the
links at 50% of my wage.

1063
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,710
So that's the trade-off.

1064
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:54,773
Now, how do we think about
evaluating that trade-off?

1065
00:44:54,773 --> 00:44:56,690
Evaluating that trade-off,
different countries

1066
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,640
think about it differently.

1067
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,580
In the US, we think about
it in what I would say

1068
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,420
is a fairly rational way, which
is let's consider your decision

1069
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,658
to retire at 62 versus 63.

1070
00:45:08,658 --> 00:45:10,200
The way it works in
the United States

1071
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,060
is we say, look, if you work
one year more, since it's

1072
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,797
an annuity, you will get
one less year off payment.

1073
00:45:17,797 --> 00:45:19,380
If you start at one
year later, you're

1074
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,080
going to die the same time,
you get one year less.

1075
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,420
So what we do is we pay
you more every month.

1076
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,520
Indeed, for every
year you delay,

1077
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,190
you get 6.7% more every month,
reflecting the trade-off

1078
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,080
that you're going to get it
for a shorter period of time.

1079
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,650
And that turns out
to be roughly fair.

1080
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,780
Given the expected
life of Americans,

1081
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,270
that's a roughly fair trade-off.

1082
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,310
Every year you delay
gets 6.7% more.

1083
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:46,540
In Europe, they don't have this.

1084
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,300
So every year delay, you just
get less money before you die.

1085
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,040
So let's take the example
of the Netherlands.

1086
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,730
In the Netherlands,
you can retire at 55

1087
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:00,760
with a benefit that is
90% of what you made.

1088
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,450
So if you earned $30,000,
you can retire at 55

1089
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,510
with a benefit of $27,000.

1090
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:11,530
And if you decide
to work instead,

1091
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:13,310
you just forego that $27,000.

1092
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,980
There's no bump up
of your benefits.

1093
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,938
That's just one less
year of $27,000 you get.

1094
00:46:17,938 --> 00:46:19,980
So what that means, if
you're in the Netherlands,

1095
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,010
your choice is work and
get 30,000 or stay home

1096
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,080
and get 27,000.

1097
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,200
In other words, it's
sort of like a 90% tax.

1098
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,110
Think about it-- by working
relative to staying home,

1099
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:34,050
I'm only keeping 3,000
of the 30,000 I made.

1100
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,690
It's basically like a 90% tax.

1101
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,180
But that's not all.

1102
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,130
How do they pay
for this program?

1103
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:41,838
They tax people.

1104
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:43,380
You can't tax people
who are at home.

1105
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,090
You've got to tax workers.

1106
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:49,530
So if you work, you also
have to pay a 45% tax

1107
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,710
to pay for this program
and lots of other things.

1108
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,140
45% tax is a high tax
rate for everything.

1109
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,260
What that means is if you
stay at home, you get 27,000.

1110
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,780
If you go to work,
you get 30,000 times

1111
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:10,120
1.55, or about 18,000.

1112
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,430
That's 1.6, It's 16, 5.

1113
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:17,710
So your choice is stay at home
and get 27, work and get 16, 5.

1114
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,460
Guess what?

1115
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,410
No one works.

1116
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,812
No one over 55 in the
Netherlands works, like zero.

1117
00:47:23,812 --> 00:47:26,020
And they might work on the
black market and ways they

1118
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,360
don't report to the government.

1119
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,700
But basically, they just sort
of sit around coffee shops

1120
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,640
and spend their
retirement money.

1121
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,280
So here's a case where they've
made a very different decision

1122
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,110
about how to make
this trade-off, which

1123
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:41,250
is it's a pretty sweet life for
the elderly in the Netherlands,

1124
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,190
but no one's
working over age 55.

1125
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,440
And that's a different way
to resolve this trade-off.

1126
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,270
So basically, this illustrates
different design features

1127
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,255
of the program.

1128
00:47:52,255 --> 00:47:53,880
What makes the
Netherlands program have

1129
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,030
much more moral hazard than the
US is the benefits are higher

1130
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:00,050
and they don't increase your
benefits if you work more.

1131
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:03,230
So essentially, these are
little kind of tweaky details

1132
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,980
that turn out to matter
enormously for how

1133
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,957
we think about the program.

1134
00:48:06,957 --> 00:48:08,540
Now, I hope you find
that interesting.

1135
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,100
That was a lot to
put in one lecture.

1136
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,850
Like I said, if you
find this interesting,

1137
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,880
there's the whole third of a
semester in my class 14.41.

1138
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,690
So take that.

1139
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,070
We can learn a
lot more about it.
