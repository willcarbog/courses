JONATHAN GRUBER: This is 14.01.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,250
I'm John Gruber, and
this is microeconomics.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,500
Today, I want to
cover three things.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,840
I want to talk about
the course details.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,910
I want to talk about
what is microeconomics.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,120
And then I'll start the
substance of the course

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,447
by talking about
supply and demand.

11
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:33,530
Couple of the points about
the course-- the course

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,710
will have a distinct sort
of policy angle to it.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,680
I sort of do economic policy,
government policy is my thing.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,890
So I think it's what
makes economics exciting

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,080
and it sort of offers, I
think, an interesting angle

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,480
to understand why we're
learning what we're learning.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,980
I think sometimes
in an intro class,

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,813
it's sort of hard to
understand why the heck

19
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:52,700
you're doing things.

20
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,690
However, that's just
sort of a slight flavor.

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,730
If you're really more
interested in this,

22
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,463
I teach a whole
course called 1441.

23
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:59,005
I'm not teaching it
this year, but it

24
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:02,000
will be taught by a visitor
in the spring, Kristin Butcher

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,860
from Wellesley.

26
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,190
And I'll be teaching next year.

27
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,527
That dives much more
into these policy issues.

28
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:09,110
So I'm going to use government
policy as sort of an organizing

29
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,500
theme, but it won't be the
dominant theme of the class.

30
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,297
Finally, three points
about my teaching style.

31
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:16,880
I don't write
everything on the board.

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,255
We're not in high
school anymore.

33
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:21,140
You're actually responsible for
what I say, not what I write.

34
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,170
Partly that's because my
handwriting is brutal,

35
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,840
as you can tell already.

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,240
So what that means is,
please, please do not

37
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,090
be afraid to ask me what the
hell I just wrote on the board.

38
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,380
There's no shame in that.

39
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,830
Don't just lean to your
neighbors, and say,

40
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,840
what the hell did he
just write in the board.

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,423
Ask, me, because if
you can't read it,

42
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:40,380
I'm sure someone else can't
read it, so feel free to ask.

43
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,740
And in general, please
feel free to engage

44
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,360
with questions in this class.

45
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,570
The other point of my teaching
style is I talk way too fast.

46
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,820
And the longer I go-- there's
a mathematical function,

47
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,737
which is the longer I
go without interruption,

48
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,710
the faster I speak,
until I just spin off.

49
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,740
So basically, please
ask questions.

50
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,300
If anything is not
clear, or you just

51
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,030
want to ask questions
about some related tangent

52
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,125
or whatever, please
feel free to do so.

53
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,500
You might think, how would
that work in a class this big?

54
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,252
There's always way too
few questions, even

55
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:08,960
a class this big.

56
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,672
So never be afraid that it
will slow me down or whatever.

57
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:12,380
Ask me questions.

58
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,687
We have plenty of
time on the class.

59
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:16,520
And you'll be doing
your classmates a favor,

60
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,650
because it'll slow me down.

61
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,380
Finally, last point, I
have this terrible tendency

62
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,260
to use the term "guys"
in a gender neutral way.

63
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,270
So this class, I
like to see, looks

64
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,720
like it's a fairly
healthy representation

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,750
both males and females.

66
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,250
When I say "guys,"
I don't mean men.

67
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,090
I mean people.

68
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,090
I mean people.

69
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,180
So women, don't
take it personally.

70
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,373
"Guys" means economic agent.

71
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:37,040
It means people.

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,902
It doesn't mean men.

73
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:39,360
Just the way-- just
a bad tendency.

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,720
It drives my wife crazy,
but I've decided better

75
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,200
to just apologize up front
than try to fix it throughout,

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,870
which is impossible.

77
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,620
So let's talk about
what is microeconomics.

78
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,190
So fundamentally,
microeconomics-- how people

79
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,960
took AP high school Econ?

80
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,017
How many people--
for how many people

81
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,100
was it taught really well?

82
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,805
That's about right.

83
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:10,680
That's why I did my high
school online class.

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,970
That's the answer
I wanted to hear.

85
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,880
So tell your friends
still in high school who

86
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
are taking high school
Econ, if your high school

87
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,800
teacher isn't great,
tell them to go on EdX

88
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,540
and take the class.

89
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,750
And help out your friends
still in high school.

90
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,320
So what is microeconomics?

91
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,370
Microeconomics is
the study of how

92
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,160
individuals and
firms make decisions

93
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,120
in a world of scarcity.

94
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,270
Scarcity is what
drives microeconomics.

95
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,250
Basically, what
microeconomics is

96
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:52,770
is a series of constrained
optimization exercises,

97
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,030
where economic agents, be
they firms or individuals,

98
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,240
try to make themselves
as well off as possible

99
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,140
given their constraints.

100
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,640
Yeah.

101
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,740
AUDIENCE: Will this
cover irrationality?

102
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,232
JONATHAN GRUBER: I will,
but not as much as I should.

103
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:09,690
Essentially, we
have another course

104
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,690
in the department called 1413,
Behavioral Economics, which

105
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,950
gets into that much more.

106
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,560
I will sprinkle it
throughout, but not

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,430
as much as I actually
believe in it.

108
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,430
In other words, the way
we think about economics

109
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,282
is it's best to sort
of get the basics down

110
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:24,240
before you start worrying
about the deviations.

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,657
Find it's better
to climb the tree

112
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:28,680
before you start going
out in the branches.

113
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,130
So basically, what this
course is then about

114
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,420
is it's about trade-offs.

115
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,760
It's about given that
you're constrained,

116
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,450
how do you trade off things
to make yourself as well off

117
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,250
as possible?

118
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,025
And behind this notion of
trade-offs is going to be--

119
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:49,400
I'll say about 100 times this
is the most important thing

120
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,030
in the course, so
just ignore that.

121
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,160
But this is one of the
most important things.

122
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
I'll say "one of the
most important" things

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,535
in the course, is the
notion of opportunity cost.

124
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,320
Opportunity cost is a
very important concept

125
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,530
that we teach, sort of the
first concept we teach,

126
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,230
which is that every
action or every inaction

127
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,660
has a cost in that you
could've been doing something

128
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,670
else instead.

129
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,680
So if you buy a shirt, you
could have bought pants.

130
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,870
If you stayed at
home and watched TV,

131
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,180
you could have been out working.

132
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,670
Everything you do has
a next best alternative

133
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,470
you could have done instead.

134
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,630
And that is called the
"opportunity cost."

135
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,230
And that's a critical
concept in economics,

136
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,790
and that is why,
in some sense, we

137
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,292
are referred to casually
as the "dismal science."

138
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:42,250
Economics is referred to
as the dismal science.

139
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,920
First of all, I'm flattered
we're considered a science.

140
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,480
But it's called the
"dismal science"

141
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,573
because our whole point
is that nothing is free.

142
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:50,740
There is always a trade-off.

143
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,198
There's always an
opportunity cost.

144
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:56,290
Anything you do, you could be
doing something else instead.

145
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,670
And your constrained
optimization

146
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,890
means you're going to
have to pass up one thing

147
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,330
to do another.

148
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,820
Now, some may call it
"dismal," but as a former MIT

149
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,680
undergraduate, I call it "fun."

150
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,810
And this is why I think
MIT is the perfect place

151
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,452
to be teaching economics,
because MIT engineering is

152
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:12,910
all about constrained
optimization.

153
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,355
That's what engineering is.

154
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:15,730
And economics is
just the engine.

155
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,860
It's just the principles
you learn in engineering

156
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,890
applied in different contexts.

157
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,540
So if we think about the
2.007 contests-- that still

158
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,210
exist with the robots, 2.007?

159
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,432
Yeah, the 2.007 contests,
those, as you know,

160
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,890
are contests where you're given
a limited set of materials.

161
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,990
And you have to build a
robot that does some task,

162
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,020
like pushing ping-pong balls off
a table or something like that.

163
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,800
That's just constraint
optimization.

164
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,050
It's got nothing to
do with economics,

165
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,930
but it's constrained
optimization.

166
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:50,560
So just think of microeconomics
as like engineering,

167
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,800
but actually interesting.

168
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,550
So think of microeconomics
as engineering,

169
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,000
but instead of
building something

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,750
to push a ping-pong ball
off tables, you actually

171
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,030
build people's lives,
and businesses,

172
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,233
and understand the decisions
that drive our economy.

173
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,650
So same principles
you could think

174
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,410
of for your engineering classes,
but applied to people's lives.

175
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,827
And that's why, in fact, modern
economics was born in this

176
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:15,970
room, this room or 26.100 by
Paul Samuelson in the 1940s

177
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,630
and '50s, who wrote the
fundamental textbook that gave

178
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,250
birth to modern economics.

179
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,680
Because he was here and
applied the kind of engineering

180
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,080
principles of MIT
to actually develop

181
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,580
the field of modern economics.

182
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,470
What we'll learn today
was developed at MIT,

183
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,820
so it's a great place
to be learning it.

184
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,040
Now, with that as background--
any questions about that,

185
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,560
about what is microeconomics?

186
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,780
With that as
background, let's turn

187
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,920
to our first model we'll talk
about this semester, which

188
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,330
is the supply and demand model.

189
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,750
Supply and demand--
now, the way we're

190
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,800
going to proceed in this course
is going to drive you crazy,

191
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,500
because we're going to
proceed by teaching,

192
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,210
as the very first
question pointed out,

193
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,930
by teaching very
simplified models.

194
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,210
We're going to essentially--
what is a model?

195
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,800
A model is technically
a description

196
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,830
between any two or more economic
variables or any two or more

197
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,960
variables.

198
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,530
But unlike the models used
in all your other classes,

199
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,115
these aren't laws, by and
large, they're models.

200
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:28,240
So we don't have a relation
between energy and mass

201
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,282
which you can write down.

202
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:30,790
It's a law and you're done.

203
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,260
We have models which are
never 100% true, but always

204
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,299
pretty true, "pretty"
being somewhere

205
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,900
between 10% and 95% true.

206
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,650
So basically, the idea
is to make a trade-off.

207
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,750
We want to write
down in our models

208
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,480
a set of simplifying
assumptions that

209
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,050
allow us, with a relatively
small set of steps,

210
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,790
to capture relatively
broad phenomena.

211
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,800
So it's essentially a trade-off.

212
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,690
On the one hand,
we'd like a model

213
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,480
that captures as well as
possible the phenomena

214
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,470
in the real world, like
E equals Mc squared.

215
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,230
But we want to do so in the
most tractable possible way

216
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,150
so that we can teach it
from first principles,

217
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:20,930
and don't need an arrow to teach
every single insight we have.

218
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,600
So basically in
economics, we tend

219
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,007
to resolve that by erring
on the side of tractability.

220
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:29,840
That is why I can teach
you the entire field

221
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,862
of microeconomics--
which is really sort of--

222
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,320
macro is kind of
a fun application.

223
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,507
Micro is really economics.

224
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,590
I can teach you the entire
field of microeconomics

225
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,150
in the semester,
because I'm going

226
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,730
to make a whole huge set
of simplifying assumptions

227
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,160
to make things tractable.

228
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,710
But the key thing
is that you will

229
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,650
be amazed at what these
models will be able to do.

230
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,065
With a fairly simple
set of models,

231
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:52,940
we will be able to offer
insights and explain

232
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,340
a whole huge variety
of phenomena,

233
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,980
never perfectly, but
always pretty well,

234
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,260
generally pretty well.

235
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,940
And so that is
essentially the trade-off

236
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,950
we're going to try
to do this semester.

237
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,860
So the line I like
is the statistician

238
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,810
George Box said that all models
are wrong, but some are useful.

239
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,230
Now obviously, it doesn't apply
to models in the hard sciences,

240
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,830
but in the social
sciences, that's true.

241
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,420
And basically, I'm
going to write down

242
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,160
a set of models like that.

243
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,070
Now, with every model I write
down, I'm going to try--

244
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,630
my goal is to have you
understand it at three levels.

245
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,420
The first and most
important level

246
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,750
is the intuitive
level, the level

247
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,340
which you sort of understand.

248
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,213
I call it "passing
the Mom Test."

249
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:38,630
You can go home and explain
it to your mom at Thanksgiving

250
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,910
or at the end of semester.

251
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,032
No offense to dads, just
called it "the Mom Test."

252
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:45,740
So basically, that's
the intuitive level.

253
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,590
You really understand it in a
way that you could explain it.

254
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,703
The second is graphical.

255
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:52,370
We were going to do--
most of our models

256
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,490
here were developed in a
graphical framework using

257
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,250
x/y graphs that really in
economics, we think delivers

258
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,020
a lot of shorthand power.

259
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,478
And the third is mathematical.

260
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:06,520
The mathematical is probably
the least important,

261
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,510
but it's the easiest
to test you on.

262
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:14,200
So we're going to need to know
things mathematically as well.

263
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,430
So let's start by considering
the supply and demand

264
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,000
model by using
the famous example

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,920
brought up by Adam Smith.

266
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,463
Adam Smith is sort of considered
the father of economics.

267
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:28,630
If Paul Samuelson is the
father of modern economics,

268
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,550
Adam Smith is the
father of all economics.

269
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,700
His 1776 book, The
Wealth of Nations

270
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,100
did an incredible job
of actually laying out

271
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,070
the entire core of
the economics field--

272
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,750
no math, just words,
but he just nailed it.

273
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,400
And one of his most
famous examples

274
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,340
was the water diamond paradox.

275
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,110
He said, think about
water and diamonds.

276
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,193
He said, start with water.

277
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:53,110
Nothing is more important
for life than water.

278
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,860
It's the building
block of all of life.

279
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,910
Even when we look for
life on other planets,

280
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,080
we always start by
looking for water.

281
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,450
Now think of diamonds, one
of the more frivolous things

282
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,990
you can buy, certainly
irrelevant to leading

283
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,010
a successful or happy or
productive life, or any life.

284
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,550
Yet for most of us,
water's free and diamonds

285
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,800
are super expensive.

286
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,140
How can this be,
Adam Smith asked.

287
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,560
Well, the answer he posed is
that what I first described

288
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,940
was just demand.

289
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,800
That is, we demand
lots of water.

290
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,590
We demand fewer diamonds.

291
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,860
But we have to match that
with the concept of supply.

292
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,870
And the supply of water
is almost infinite,

293
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,110
while the supply of diamonds--
maybe not naturally,

294
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,480
maybe it's through decisions
of various businesses--

295
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,410
but it's somewhat limited.

296
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,700
So basically what
he developed is

297
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,000
what we call the "supply
and demand scissors"--

298
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,730
that you can't just think of
supply or demand in isolation.

299
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,680
You have to put
them together if you

300
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,920
want to explain the real world
phenomena we see, like the fact

301
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,150
that water is cheap and
diamonds are expensive.

302
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,663
So let's just about an example.

303
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:04,330
So there's one graph
that was handed out

304
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,570
in the back, which
is, let's talk

305
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,695
about the market for roses.

306
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:18,580
So in the market for roses,
we have a demand curve

307
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,503
and a supply curve.

308
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:21,670
So what we have here-- this
is the kind of x/y graph

309
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,310
we're going to look at all
throughout the semester.

310
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,880
On the x-axis is the
quantity of roses.

311
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,610
On the y-axis is
the price of roses.

312
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,580
The blue, downward-sloping
line is the demand curve.

313
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,550
Now, what I'm going to do here,
I'm just giving you a overview.

314
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,720
We are going, over the next
five or six lectures, dive

315
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,180
into where this demand
curve comes from.

316
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,388
We'll go to first principles
and build it back up.

317
00:13:47,388 --> 00:13:48,930
But for now, what
we know of a demand

318
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,040
curve is it simply
represents the relationship

319
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,620
between the price of a good
and how much people want it.

320
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,440
Therefore, we assume
it is downward sloping.

321
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,500
At higher prices, people
want less of the good.

322
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,660
And we'll derive where
that comes from shortly,

323
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,110
starting next lecture.

324
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,550
But for now, I think
it's pretty intuitive

325
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,450
that if the price
of roses is higher,

326
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,710
people want fewer of them.

327
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,650
And that's why it's
downward sloping.

328
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,960
Basically, as the
price of roses goes up,

329
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,750
people want fewer roses.

330
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,030
The yellow curve is
the supply curve.

331
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,780
Now, after we've derived
the demand curve,

332
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,877
we'll then go and
spend about 12 lectures

333
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:28,960
deriving the supply curve.

334
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,793
That's a bit harder.

335
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:31,835
But once again, we'll
start from first principles

336
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:32,860
and build it up.

337
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,050
For now, you just need to
know that's how much firms

338
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,510
are willing to supply,
given the price.

339
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,180
So basically, as
the price goes up,

340
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,210
firms want to
produce more roses.

341
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,290
The higher price means
you make more money,

342
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,560
so you want to
produce more of them.

343
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,960
This is slightly less
intuitive than demand,

344
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,195
but we'll derive it and
explain how it can be.

345
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,070
But for now, just go
with the basic intuition

346
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,985
that if you're making
something, and you can sell it

347
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:57,360
in the market for
a higher price,

348
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,390
you're going to want
to make more of it.

349
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,780
And that leads to the
upward sloping supply curve.

350
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,180
Where the points meet is
the market equilibrium.

351
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,870
Where supply and demand meets
is the market equilibrium.

352
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,910
And that is the point where
both consumers and producers are

353
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,430
happy to make a transaction.

354
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,180
Consumers are happy because
on their demand curve

355
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,770
is the $3 and 600 roses.

356
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,667
That is, they are willing
to buy 600 roses at $3.

357
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,500
Producers are happy,
because on their supply

358
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,150
curve is the same point.

359
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,110
They are willing to
supply 600 roses at $3.

360
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,020
That is the one point
where consumers are happy

361
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,490
and producers are happy.

362
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,930
Therefore, it's
the equilibrium--

363
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,762
highly non-technical, but
that's the basic intuition.

364
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:51,720
The point at which they're
both willing to make

365
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,890
that transaction, the
point at which they're

366
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,810
both satisfied with
that transaction,

367
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,630
is the equilibrium, which
in this case is $3 per

368
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,120
rose and 600 roses.

369
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,008
Now, this raises
lots of questions.

370
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,300
Where did the curves come from?

371
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,880
How does equilibrium
get achieved?

372
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,290
Why the heck do we give roses?

373
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,700
These are a bunch of questions.

374
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,880
We will come to
all these questions

375
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,220
over the next set of lectures.

376
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,750
But the basic thing
is to understand

377
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,875
this intuition of Adam Smith's
supply and demand model.

378
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,750
Questions about that?

379
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:31,035
Now, this model also raises
another important distinction

380
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:32,410
that we'll focus
on this semester

381
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,000
and is easy to get mixed up.

382
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,770
So I want you to, if
you're ever unclear,

383
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,240
I want you to ask me about it.

384
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,080
And that's the distinction
between positive

385
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:50,280
versus normative analyses--
positive versus normative.

386
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,550
Positive analysis is the
study of the way things are,

387
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,970
while normative
analyses is the study

388
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,050
of the way things should be.

389
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,810
A positive analysis is the
study of the way things are,

390
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,880
while normative
analysis is the study

391
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,040
of the way things should be.

392
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:14,160
Let me give you a great
example, which is eBay auctions.

393
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,950
Auctions are a terrific example.

394
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,410
They're like the
textbook example

395
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,660
of a competitive market.

396
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,920
You can see it in your head--

397
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,640
demand comes as a bunch of
people going on and bidding.

398
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,599
People who want
it more bid more,

399
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,460
so you actually
get a demand curve.

400
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,400
The higher the price, the fewer
people you're getting to bid.

401
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,210
Supply is how many units
of it are for sale on eBay.

402
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,120
You bid until those two meet.

403
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,340
And then you have a
market equilibrium

404
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,490
at that bidded price.

405
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,450
Now, one example
of an eBay auction

406
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,190
that got a lot of attention
a number of years ago,

407
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,610
early in the days
of eBay, was someone

408
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,292
offered their
kidney for auction.

409
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:54,750
They said, look,
I got two kidneys.

410
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,675
You only need one to live.

411
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,550
There are people out
there who need a kidney.

412
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,330
I'm putting my kidney
on eBay for auction.

413
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,160
And what happened,
bidding went nuts.

414
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,960
It started at $25,000.

415
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,130
It climbed to $5 million before
the auction was shut down,

416
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,820
and eBay decided
they wouldn't allow

417
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:15,150
you to sell your body on
eBay, bodily parts on eBay.

418
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,310
So this raises two questions.

419
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,820
The first is the
positive question,

420
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,542
why did the price go so high?

421
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:24,750
So what's the answer to that?

422
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,692
What's the answer to
the positive question?

423
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:29,195
AUDIENCE: Somebody
wanted a kidney.

424
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,320
JONATHAN GRUBER: Good
answer, but let's raise hands

425
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,040
and give answers.

426
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,940
That's part of it.

427
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,004
Yeah.

428
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:34,830
AUDIENCE: Low
supply, high demand.

429
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,538
JONATHAN GRUBER: Low
supply, high demand.

430
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:38,978
Demand is incredibly high,
because I'd die without it.

431
00:18:38,978 --> 00:18:40,770
Supply is low, because
like not a lot of us

432
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,145
are willing to
sell their kidneys

433
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:47,490
on eBay So low supply, high
demand led to a high price--

434
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,820
Adam Smith at work.

435
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,200
That's the positive analysis.

436
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,990
But then there's the
normative question, which is,

437
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,130
should you be allowed to
sell your kidneys on eBay?

438
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,380
That's the normative question.

439
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,280
The positive question is,
what happens if you do?

440
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,150
The normative question
is, should you?

441
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,000
Now, the standard
economics answer to start

442
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,820
would be, of course you should.

443
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,370
We're in a world where
thousands of people

444
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,310
die every year because there's
a waiting list for a kidney

445
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,385
transplant.

446
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:24,760
and these are people who would
happily pay a lot of money

447
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,580
to stay alive, I presume.

448
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,880
Meanwhile, there's
hundreds of millions

449
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,610
of people walking around with
two kidneys who only need one.

450
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,980
And many of these
people are poor.

451
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,500
And lives could be changed
by being paid $1 million

452
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,292
for their kidney, and might be
happy to take the risk that one

453
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:47,250
kidney will be fine, as
it is for most everyone

454
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,230
for most of their
life, in return

455
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,650
for having a life-changing
payment from a stranger.

456
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,700
So economists say, look--

457
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,240
here's a transaction that
makes both parties better off.

458
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,150
The person who gets the
kidney gets to stay alive,

459
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,180
and they are willing to
pay a huge amount for that.

460
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,880
The person who sells the
kidney in most probability

461
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,723
is fine, because
almost all of us

462
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:09,640
can make it through life
fine with one kidney,

463
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,940
and create a life-changing
amount of money that

464
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,650
could allow them to pursue
their dreams in various ways.

465
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,350
So that's the standard
argument, would be,

466
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,700
yeah, you should be able to
sell your kidneys on eBay.

467
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,070
So the question is, why not?

468
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,420
Why would we want to
stop this transaction?

469
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,020
What are the
counter-arguments to that?

470
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,950
Let's raise our hands.

471
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,170
Yeah.

472
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,400
AUDIENCE: Potentially, I
think maybe the issue is

473
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,850
because on eBay, there's
no way to regulate it

474
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,810
or you don't necessarily know.

475
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,942
People could be like selling
fake kidneys, per se.

476
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:42,900
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

477
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,030
So the first type
of problem comes out

478
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,000
of the category we
call "market failures."

479
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,730
Market failures are reasons
why the market doesn't

480
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,260
work in the wonderful
way economists

481
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,370
like to think it should.

482
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,710
So for example,
this answer puts up

483
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,570
there could be the
problem of fraud.

484
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,890
People might not be
able to tell if they're

485
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,010
getting a legit kidney or not.

486
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,092
There could be the example
of imperfect information.

487
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,640
Do you know what the
odds are that you

488
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,270
can spend the rest of your
life with only one kidney?

489
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,370
I don't either.

490
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,080
We ought to know that before
we start selling our kidneys.

491
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,820
There could be
imperfect information.

492
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,780
This is one type of problem,
which is the market,

493
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,390
maybe the market may fail.

494
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:42,940
Yeah.

495
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,510
AUDIENCE: Well, the
current system also

496
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,590
holds people who are poor
and have a failed kidney--

497
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,590
and which are people who would
be completely screwed otherwise

498
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,290
in the [INAUDIBLE] system.

499
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,030
JONATHAN GRUBER:
A second problem

500
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,850
is what we call
"equity" or "fairness."

501
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:07,440
Equity or fairness, which is
we would end up with a world

502
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,470
where only rich people
would get kidneys.

503
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,560
Currently, there's a bunch of
voluntary donors and people

504
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,800
who are in accidents who
have kidneys left over.

505
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,750
And those go to people
on the basis of where

506
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,440
they are on a waiting list.

507
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,400
It's actually a
prioritized waiting list.

508
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,480
It's kind of a cool--

509
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,480
one of my colleagues, Nikhil
Agarwal, if you think about--

510
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,390
I'll talk a lot this semester
about the imperialistic view

511
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,880
of economics, all the
cool things we can study.

512
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,280
So he actually uses
economic models

513
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,360
to study the optimal way to
allocate organs to individuals.

514
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,600
now it's just done
based on a waiting list,

515
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,240
but it may be that someone
further down the waiting

516
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,010
list needs it more than someone
higher up the waiting list

517
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,220
because they're more
critical or whatever.

518
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,053
So there's various
optimal ways to allocate.

519
00:22:47,053 --> 00:22:48,803
But certainly, the
optimal way to allocate

520
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:50,580
wouldn't be the rich
guy gets it first.

521
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,610
That would be unlikely to be
what society would necessarily

522
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,410
want.

523
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,890
So there's an equity
concern with that.

524
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,410
What else?

525
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,102
What other-- yeah.

526
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:02,520
AUDIENCE: In that
situation, since you

527
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,680
know you can make money
off of selling kidneys,

528
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,420
and you take advantage
of people, it's very bad,

529
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,113
the black market for kidneys.

530
00:23:09,113 --> 00:23:11,280
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right, so
there's sort of a third--

531
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,697
it's related to
fraud, but there's

532
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:14,490
sort of a third
class of failures

533
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:18,300
that gets into the question
about behavioral economics

534
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:23,682
that was raised earlier, which
we could just call behavioral--

535
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:25,140
it's called
"behavioral economics,"

536
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,680
for want of a better term,
which is essentially,

537
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,200
people don't always
make decisions

538
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,900
in the perfectly rational,
logical way we will model them

539
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,140
as doing so this semester.

540
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,490
People make mistakes.

541
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,700
That's a word we hate
using in economics.

542
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,783
We hate saying "mistakes."

543
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:42,110
Ooh, boo, mistakes--
nobody makes mistakes.

544
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,610
We're all perfectly
economic beings.

545
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,290
But we know that's not true.

546
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,723
Increasingly over the
past several decades,

547
00:23:47,723 --> 00:23:49,640
economists have started
incorporating insights

548
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,812
from psychology into our
models, to not just say

549
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:55,770
people make mistakes,
that their lackadaisical,

550
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,190
but to rigorously model the
nature of those mistakes

551
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:02,070
and understand how
mistakes can actually

552
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,300
happen due to various cognitive
biases and other things.

553
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,940
In this world, you can imagine
people could make mistakes.

554
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,100
They could not really
sit down and quite

555
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,048
understand what
they're doing, and they

556
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:15,090
could have sold their
kidney when it's really not

557
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,300
in their own long-term interest.

558
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,880
Yeah.

559
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,670
AUDIENCE: Would
another example be

560
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,967
if there's a family that
is in extreme poverty,

561
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:22,550
even though they
only have one kidney,

562
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,060
they might sell the other
one, just to get more

563
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,650
money for the family, per se?

564
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,970
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, in
some sense that would be,

565
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,280
once again--

566
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,700
if we took this factor out,
if the market works well

567
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
with its behavioral
effects, we'd say, you know,

568
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,350
that's their decision.

569
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,550
If they otherwise they
starve, who are you to say?

570
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,950
But once you choose
this, say, wait a second,

571
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,200
maybe they're not evaluating
the trade-offs correctly.

572
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,840
Even if there's no fraud, even
if there's perfect information,

573
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,552
they may not know how to process
that information correctly.

574
00:24:51,552 --> 00:24:53,010
But that is not
standard economics.

575
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,552
That's not what we'll spend a
lot of time on in the semester,

576
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,270
but it's obviously realistic.

577
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,750
So those are a bunch of good
comments, great comments.

578
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,790
And yeah.

579
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,050
AUDIENCE: Also, in
inelastic demand,

580
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,042
such that people
always need kidneys--

581
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:09,250
JONATHAN GRUBER: That won't
turn out to be a problem.

582
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,562
That doesn't turn
out to be a problem.

583
00:25:11,562 --> 00:25:13,270
We'll come back--
that's a great comeback

584
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,010
that we talk about the
shape of demand curves.

585
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,570
We want to return to that
question in a few lectures,

586
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,400
but that doesn't
actually cause a problem.

587
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,110
It's just that's more of
a positive thing about why

588
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,570
the price is so high, but it's
not a normative issue about

589
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,240
whether you should
allow it or not.

590
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,450
So basically,
these are exactly--

591
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,460
to me, honestly, I spend
my life thinking a lot

592
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,252
about these things.

593
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:33,110
I think these are really
interesting issues.

594
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,990
But you can't get to
the normative issues

595
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,740
without the positive analysis.

596
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,890
You do the positive
analysis to understand

597
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,050
the economic framework
before you start

598
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,670
jumping to drawing conclusions.

599
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,390
That's no fun.

600
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,900
We all want to jump
to draw conclusions,

601
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,390
saying this should happen,
this shouldn't happen.

602
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,140
You can't do that.

603
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,890
We have to be disciplined.

604
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,240
We have to start with the
fundamental economic framework.

605
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,908
And basically, the bottom line--

606
00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:57,950
I said I'll teach this
course with a policy bent,

607
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,530
but you have to recognize
that economics at its core

608
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,630
is a right-wing science.

609
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,910
Economics at its
core is all about how

610
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,390
the market knows best, and that
basically governments only mess

611
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,490
things up.

612
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,497
That's sort of the
basic, a lot of what

613
00:26:13,497 --> 00:26:14,580
we'll learn this semester.

614
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,038
As the semester
goes on, we'll talk

615
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:17,670
about what's wrong
with that view

616
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,900
and how governments
can improve things.

617
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,067
Indeed, I teach a whole
course about the proper role

618
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:22,600
of government the economy.

619
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,460
But the standard of economics
is, "the market knows best."

620
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,670
And that leads us to the last
thing I want to talk about,

621
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,330
which is basically, how freely
should an economy function?

622
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,305
Let's step back to
the giant picture.

623
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:36,930
Let's step back from
a market for roses

624
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,760
to the entire economy.

625
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,000
How freely should a market,
should an economy function?

626
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,740
We have what's known as
a "capitalistic economy."

627
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,770
In a capitalistic economy,
firms and individuals

628
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,080
decide what to
produce and consume,

629
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,090
maybe subject to some rules of
the road set by the government.

630
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,730
There's some minimum
rules of the road

631
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,100
to try to avoid fraud
or misinformation,

632
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,110
but otherwise, we
let the dice roll.

633
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,970
Firms let consumers
decide sort of what to do.

634
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,770
Now, this has led to
tremendous growth.

635
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,730
America was not
a wealthy nation,

636
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,660
was not a very wealthy
nation 100 years ago,

637
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,140
or 150 years ago.

638
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,210
Led to tremendous
growth, where we are now

639
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,585
the most powerful, still the
most powerful and wealthiest

640
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:24,160
nation the world, largely driven
by the capitalistic nature

641
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,020
of our economy.

642
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,120
On the other hand,
we are a nation

643
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,190
with tremendous inequality.

644
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,720
We are by far the most unequal
major nation in the world.

645
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,460
The top 1% of Americans has a
much higher share of our income

646
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,500
than in any other large
country in the world,

647
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,830
any other large developed
country in the world.

648
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,830
The bottom 99% has less of
our income corresponding

649
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,970
with anywhere else.

650
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,910
So it's led to major inequality.

651
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,420
And it's led to other problems.

652
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,970
It turns out that the
government can't appropriately

653
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,460
set the rules of the road to
avoid things like fraud, as we

654
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,890
saw with Enron, if you
remember back to that,

655
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,320
or a lot of what happened
in the financial meltdown.

656
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,820
It turns out it's
hard to get people

657
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,395
perfect information, et cetera.

658
00:28:05,395 --> 00:28:06,520
So we've seen the problems.

659
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,650
We've grown very
wealthy as a nation.

660
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,230
We've introduced a whole set of
problems through this system.

661
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,390
Now, the other extreme is what's
called the "command economy."

662
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,160
Rather than a
capitalist economy,

663
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,370
it's what's called
a "command economy."

664
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,820
In this case, the government
makes all the production

665
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,960
and consumption decisions.

666
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,210
The government doesn't just
set the rules of the road,

667
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,460
the government owns the road.

668
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,710
The government says, we're
going to use this many cars

669
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,200
this year.

670
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,770
And people can get
them in some way.

671
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,770
It could be a lottery,
could be waiting in line.

672
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,510
How do we decide how
to allocate them?

673
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,890
We're not going to let
the market allocate them.

674
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,515
We, the government,
will allocate them.

675
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:47,230
We'll allocate how many get
produced and who gets them.

676
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,980
And this was the model
of the Soviet Union

677
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,630
that I grew up with.

678
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:55,670
This was the pre-1989
Soviet Union.

679
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,410
The government decided how many
shirts, cars, TVs, everything.

680
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,243
It's sort of bizarre
to think that literally

681
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:03,363
everything the government
decided how much to produce.

682
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:05,780
And by and large, the government
decided who got it partly

683
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,690
through corruption-- that
is, the party members,

684
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,130
party leaders got it first--

685
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,950
and often just through waiting
in line for the remaining

686
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,870
application.

687
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,960
Now in theory,
this ensured equity

688
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,450
by making sure that
everybody had shot at things.

689
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,790
In practice, it didn't
work well at all

690
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,470
and actually was
what dragged down

691
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,810
the collapse of the
old Soviet economy,

692
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:30,550
was that the command
model simply doesn't work.

693
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,850
Partly there's just too many
opportunities for corruption.

694
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,530
When the government
controls everything,

695
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:40,150
that means there's no checks
and balances on the opportunity

696
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,490
for enormous corruption.

697
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,990
The capitalist economy puts
some natural checks and balances

698
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,560
on that.

699
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,380
And partly because it
turns out that it's

700
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,150
hard to control human nature.

701
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,980
And Adam Smith had it right.

702
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,680
Adam Smith talks about
the "invisible hand"

703
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,150
of the capitalist economy.

704
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,115
The invisible hand is
basically the notion

705
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:00,740
that the capitalist
economy will manage

706
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,510
to distribute things roughly in
proportion to what people want.

707
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,910
And that's where
folks want to be.

708
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,470
Folks who want a
certain kind of car

709
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,120
are going to want to
get to that kind of car,

710
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,680
and if the government
has it wrong,

711
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,805
they're going to get upset.

712
00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:17,850
And it's going to lead to
a less functional economy.

713
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,590
So basically, Adam
Smith's view is that--

714
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,250
the invisible hand view is that
consumers and firms serving

715
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,080
their own best interest will
do what is best for society.

716
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,510
So the fundamental core
of the capitalistic view

717
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,770
is that consumers and firms
serving their own best interest

718
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,207
will do what ends up
being best for society.

719
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:41,790
And that's essentially
the model we'll

720
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,940
learn to start in this course.

721
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,890
Yeah.

722
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,390
AUDIENCE: In that
definition, are we

723
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,680
defining the best for
society as in everybody

724
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,120
has the most money?

725
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,892
Or everyone has the best health
or the best standard of living?

726
00:30:56,892 --> 00:30:58,100
What is the best [INAUDIBLE]?

727
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,830
JONATHAN GRUBER: Great question.

728
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,170
We're going to spend a lot
of the semester talking

729
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,100
about that.

730
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,650
For now, we're going to
define "best for society"

731
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,062
as the most stuff gets
produced and consumed.

732
00:31:07,062 --> 00:31:08,520
That's how we're
going to find it--

733
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,312
obviously raises a set
of issues about what

734
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:13,120
about pollution, what
about health, et cetera.

735
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,630
We're going to come to those,
but for the first two-thirds

736
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,630
of the course "best
for society" means

737
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,270
what we're going to call
"maximum surplus," which

738
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,230
is the most stuff gets
produced that people value.

739
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,730
So that's how we're
going to do it.

740
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,647
And in his view, the
invisible hand does that.

741
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:35,730
And by and large, it's a very
helpful framework to turn to.

742
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,890
However, at least it
can lead to outcomes

743
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,730
that are not very fair.

744
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,060
So the way we're going
to proceed in this course

745
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,550
is we're going to start
by talking about how

746
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,290
Adam Smith's magic works.

747
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,880
How does the magic happen?

748
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,800
How does individuals
and firms acting

749
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,950
in their own self-interest,
without caring about anybody

750
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:58,530
else, end up yielding
the largest possible

751
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,750
productive economy?

752
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,442
How does that happen?

753
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:03,900
And we're going to
talk about that.

754
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,940
We'll start with
demand, which is

755
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,560
how do consumers
decide what they

756
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,120
want given their resources.

757
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,805
We'll talk about the principle
of utility maximization,

758
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,430
the idea that I have
a utility function

759
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,300
that I can mathematically
write down what I want.

760
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,940
I'll have a budget constraint,
which is the resources I have,

761
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,950
and those two
constrain optimization.

762
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,258
We'll say given what I want
and the resource I have,

763
00:32:25,258 --> 00:32:26,300
what decisions do I make?

764
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,280
Boom, we get the demand curve.

765
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Then we'll turn to supply, and
we'll talk about how do firms

766
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,368
decide what to produce.

767
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,160
That's much more
complicated, because firms

768
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,030
have to decide
what inputs to use

769
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,560
and what outputs to produce.

770
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,510
And we'll talk about
how firms can operate

771
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,230
in very different markets.

772
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,710
There is a competitive market
that Adam Smith envisioned,

773
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,918
but that doesn't always work.

774
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:50,490
Sometimes we get
monopoly markets,

775
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,713
where one firm dominates.

776
00:32:51,713 --> 00:32:53,130
And you can actually
have outcomes

777
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,080
which aren't the best
possible outcome, even

778
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,290
with the invisible hand.

779
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,860
So we'll talk about
different kinds of markets.

780
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,830
Then we'll put it together
to get market equilibrium,

781
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,900
and talk about
Smith's principles.

782
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,780
And then from there, we'll
talk about how it breaks down

783
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,940
in reality, different
change in reality,

784
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,310
how there are various
market failures that

785
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,710
can get in the way, why we
have to care about equity

786
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,830
and what implications that has,
about behavioral economics,

787
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,260
about a set of other factors.

788
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,930
So that's basically how we're
going to proceed this semester.

789
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,960
As I said, the
lectures are important,

790
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,060
but the recitations are as well.

791
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,950
Once we're sort of
in steady state,

792
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:34,690
the recitations will be about
half new material and half

793
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,760
working through problems
to help you prepare

794
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,855
for that next problem set.

795
00:33:37,855 --> 00:33:39,730
So the way the problem
sets are going to work

796
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,670
is the problem set
that's assigned

797
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,663
will cover material that's
taught up to that date.

798
00:33:44,663 --> 00:33:46,330
So for example, problem
set one is going

799
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,887
to be assigned next Friday.

800
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:49,720
That will cover everything
you've learned up

801
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,690
through next Wednesday.

802
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,340
Therefore, in section
on next Friday,

803
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,312
we'll do a practice problem
which you should understand

804
00:33:57,312 --> 00:33:59,520
because it'll cover things
that were taught in class,

805
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,103
and help prepare you
for the problems.

806
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:02,460
And we'll do that every week.

807
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,770
That's about half the section.

808
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,280
The other half of the
section will be new material.

809
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,849
This Friday, the section on
Friday is all new material.

810
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:11,170
What we do on Friday is
cover the mathematics.

811
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,620
I don't like doing math.

812
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,050
I always get it wrong.

813
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,110
So I leave math for the TAs,
who are smarter than I am.

814
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,630
So this Friday, we'll be doing
the mathematics of supply

815
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,018
and demand, and how you
take the intuition here

816
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,560
and the simple
graphics, and actually

817
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,380
turn it into mathematical
representations, which is what

818
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,790
you need for the problem sets.

819
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,780
That's this Friday.

820
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,447
Then we'll come back
on Monday and start

821
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:32,889
talking about what's
underneath the demand curve.

822
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:36,010
All right, any other questions?

823
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,860
I'll see you on Monday.
