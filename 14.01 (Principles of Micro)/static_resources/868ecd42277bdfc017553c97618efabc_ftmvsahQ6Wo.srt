00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,370
JONATHAN GRUBER:
All right, so we

2
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,080
finished the first unit of the
course, or consumer theory,

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,672
and we've sort of gotten
to the demand curve.

4
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,880
Now we move onto the second
year of the course, which

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,547
is producer theory,
and talk about where

6
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:27,330
the supply curve comes from.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,840
Now the good news is that a
lot of the tools and skills we

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,947
developed in the
first few lectures

9
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:35,280
will translate quite nicely
to thinking about the supply

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,170
curve and production.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,177
The bad news is,
supply is a lot harder.

12
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:41,560
It's a lot harder,
fundamentally,

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,140
the big picture, because
we did consumer theory.

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,420
We sort of told you
what your income was.

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,880
We told you income and
prices, and then we said,

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,400
OK, here's how to optimize.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,900
With firms, they sort of get
to decide what their income is.

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,630
They get to decide
how much they produce,

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,130
and that means we're going to
need an extra whole constraint

20
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,520
we're going need to
model, an extra other part

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,840
of the process.

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,190
So it's going to be an extra
step with producer theory,

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,270
but a lot of the tools
will be the same.

24
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,730
So let's dive in.

25
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,010
We're going to start
by talking about,

26
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,610
just as consumers have
a utility function,

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,175
producers have a
production function.

28
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,730
So the first parallel
is that producers

29
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,430
have production function.

30
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,370
Now here, their goal is
not to maximize production.

31
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,900
Their goal is to
maximize profits.

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,770
So as consumers want
to maximize utility,

33
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,260
producers want to
maximize profits, which

34
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,630
equals revenues minus costs.

35
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,290
So the goal of a producer is
to maximize profits, which

36
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,530
equals revenues minus costs.

37
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,360
And what that's
going to mean, it's

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,020
going to mean producing goods
as efficiently as possible,

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,110
maximizing your profits.

40
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,150
We are going to focus for the
first few lectures on the cost

41
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,020
part.

42
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,530
In particular, we're going to
focus on maximizing profits

43
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,630
through minimizing costs.

44
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,210
And we minimize
costs by producing

45
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,000
as efficiently as possible, OK.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,280
And that's what we'll focus
on in the next few lectures.

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,800
Now, what firms
can produce comes

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,170
from their production function.

49
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,100
A production function is
of the general form q--

50
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,425
that's units of goods produced--

51
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:37,700
is a function of the amount
of labor input and capital

52
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,360
input used by the
firm, so q, little q--

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,130
let me just
highlight right here.

54
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,510
I will hopefully get this right.

55
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,718
I never in the semester have
gotten it totally right.

56
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:48,650
Little q refers to a firm.

57
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,952
Big Q refers to a market, OK.

58
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:52,660
We're going to try to
keep this straight.

59
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,920
So little q means a firm's
production function.

60
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,830
Big Q means a market
production function, OK.

61
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,550
So if I get that wrong, I'm
sure you guys will tell me.

62
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,030
OK, so basically what a
production function does

63
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:11,570
is it converts inputs, which are
labor and capital, into output

64
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,590
through some function, just like
utility function converts goods

65
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,750
into happiness
through some function.

66
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,310
It's the same idea here, but
here, it's more tangible.

67
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,140
Unlike utils, output can
actually be measured.

68
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,980
So literally, it's not
some preference mapping.

69
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,132
It's literally a
technological function.

70
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:34,715
OK, you get your hands around
it more than a utility function.

71
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,090
It's literally a technologial
function by which inputs

72
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,820
get converted to an output.

73
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:48,330
Now, we call these inputs the
factors of production, OK.

74
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,530
Labor and capital, we call
the factors of production.

75
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,570
They're the inputs they
get used to produce things.

76
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,350
Now, what are labor and capital?

77
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,630
Labor is pretty easy.

78
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,630
Labor is workers,
OK, either number

79
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,120
of workers or hours of work.

80
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,350
we'll use those interchangeably,
but the bottom line

81
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,340
is, labor is workers.

82
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,460
It's you all.

83
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,130
OK, that's sort
of the easy part.

84
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,720
Capital is harder.

85
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,130
Capital is machines
land, building,

86
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,519
all the stuff that workers
use to make things, OK.

87
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,500
So capital's a vaguer concept.

88
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,740
But for now, think of it as
like machines and buildings,

89
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:32,260
OK, the stuff that workers
use to produce goods.

90
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,620
And outputs are the goods and
services that got produced.

91
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,200
Now, when we talk about inputs
or factors of production,

92
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,640
we're going to talk about
them being variable or fixed.

93
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,140
Variable means changeable,
fixed means not changeable, OK.

94
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,320
So variable inputs are inputs
that can be easily changed,

95
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,180
like hours of work.

96
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,175
You can easily work.

97
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,300
You guys work different
amounts of hours every day.

98
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,460
You can easily change
the hours that you work.

99
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,960
You can pull an all nighter if
something's due the next day.

100
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,030
You can work less if there's
something good on TV, OK.

101
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,640
Fixed inputs are those which
are harder to change quickly,

102
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,405
like the size of a plant.

103
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:18,030
Let's say you're
siding a bigger plant.

104
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,730
You can't just
instantly do that.

105
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,440
It takes a lot of
production process.

106
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,533
You can see by the giant
production going on

107
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,950
as you pass every
day as you walk,

108
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,220
if you come from east campus,
you walk to this building,

109
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,560
it's going to take years
to build out those new MIT

110
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,330
facilities, OK.

111
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,650
So it's not simple.

112
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,885
So fixed inputs are inputs that
are hard to change quickly.

113
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,260
And the key
distinction we draw--

114
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,770
and we think about
variable fixed--

115
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,050
is the short run
versus the long run.

116
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,520
And the way we define
these is that basically,

117
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,490
in the short run,
some inputs are fixed

118
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,140
and some are variable.

119
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,320
In particular, we're going
to stay in the short run,

120
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,900
labor is variable
and capital is fixed.

121
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,310
So in the short run, you have
labor and then some fixed level

122
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,073
of capital, k bar.

123
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:10,990
So in the short run,
you've got some building.

124
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,615
You can't change it,
but you can always

125
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:15,580
change how hard people
work in that building.

126
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,300
In long run
everything's variable.

127
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,670
Labor and capital are
both variable, OK,

128
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,762
so there's no k bar.

129
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:24,220
Capital's variable
in the long run.

130
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,480
So the question then is, what
is the short and the long run.

131
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Well, there's no
good answer to that.

132
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,980
Intuitively, think
of the short run

133
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,190
as a matter of days or weeks
or months and the long run

134
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,710
as a matter of years or
decades, for your own intuition.

135
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,140
But technically,
the definition is,

136
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,020
the long one is the
period of time over which

137
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,740
all inputs are variable.

138
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,150
That's the technical definition.

139
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,490
The long run is a period
of time over which

140
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,827
all inputs are variable.

141
00:06:57,827 --> 00:06:59,160
That's our technical definition.

142
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,202
So think about how long
it takes to build a plant

143
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:03,330
or make new machines, OK.

144
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,372
That's the long run.

145
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:06,330
So I'm never going to
ask you, is the short run

146
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,880
8.3 days or 9.7 days, OK.

147
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,395
There's no right answer.

148
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,270
The right answer is,
the technical answer is,

149
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,770
the short run is a period of
time over which some inputs are

150
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,428
fixed and some are variable.

151
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:18,220
The long run is the
period of time in which

152
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,770
all inputs are variable, OK.

153
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,740
And it's not a
clean distinction.

154
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,180
Obviously, in reality,
there's a whole range

155
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,110
of inputs ranging from
workers to the gas you pipe in

156
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,870
to use for your thing, to the
raw materials you have to buy

157
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,610
to the machines, the buildings.

158
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,580
Obviously, in reality, there's
a whole range of variability.

159
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,080
But once again, to
make life easier,

160
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,200
we're going to shrink this
down to two dimensions, labor

161
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,280
and capital.

162
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,960
Labor is going to
always be variable.

163
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,210
Capital's going to be fixed
in the short run, variable

164
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,910
in the long run, OK.

165
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,542
So that's how we'll boil
this down to make life easy.

166
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:51,097
Yeah.

167
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,472
AUDIENCE: Can you
give an example

168
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,514
of what capital is again?

169
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:58,320
JONATHAN GRUBER: Capital is the
buildings, machines, the stuff

170
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,105
that workers use to make things.

171
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:04,860
Yeah, OK.

172
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,180
Other questions?

173
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,540
With these definitions
in mind, let's talk

174
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,880
about short run production.

175
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,640
Let's start by talking about
production in the short run.

176
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,270
Someone needs to invent me
some more indestructible chalk.

177
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:29,530
OK, so let's start in the
short run where labor is

178
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,160
variable and capital's fixed.

179
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,610
So in the short run
production function,

180
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,640
q equals f of L and k bar, OK.

181
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,780
That's our short run
production function.

182
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,190
OK, now that means in the short
run, the firm's only decision,

183
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,780
the firm is given
a stock of capital.

184
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,060
So think of the
short run as, you

185
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,587
are hired to manage a plant.

186
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:56,170
And the plant, you
don't get to decide

187
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,080
if the plant's big or
small or what machines.

188
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,050
It's there.

189
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,633
Your only decision is
how many workers to hire,

190
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,050
how many hours of
labor to employ.

191
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,633
And once again, I'll
go back and forth

192
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,760
through a number of
workers and hours of labor.

193
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,070
The bottom line is the amount
of labor being provided, OK.

194
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,230
The way you're going
to decide that is,

195
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,900
you are going to
look at when we're

196
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,730
going to call the
marginal product of labor,

197
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,630
the marginal product of
labor, which is simply

198
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:31,240
the change in output for the
next unit of labor input.

199
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,417
This is very much like a
marginal utility of a good.

200
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,750
Once again, going back to our
powerless consumer theory,

201
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,290
the marginal
utility of pizza was

202
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,200
the delta in utility for
the next unit of pizza.

203
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,110
The marginal product
of labor is the delta

204
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,140
in the amount produced for
the next unit of labor.

205
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,320
And we are going to assume,
much as we assume diminishing

206
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,990
marginal utility, we
are going to assume

207
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:01,430
diminishing marginal product.

208
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,040
Now, that's a little
less intuitive

209
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,340
than diminishing
marginal utility was.

210
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,632
At least, I hope you found
diminishing marginal utility

211
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:09,080
kind of intuitive, that
the second slice of pizza

212
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,750
would be worth less to you
than the first slice of pizza.

213
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,180
Hope you found
that intuitive, OK.

214
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,710
Now, this is less intuitive.

215
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,570
Once again, like
with utility, it's

216
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,300
not saying the next
worker doesn't help.

217
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,590
The next worker does help.

218
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,870
It's just that the
next worker helps less

219
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,290
than the previous worker, OK.

220
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,660
Now, this isn't true everywhere.

221
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,360
Obviously, there are tasks
where having two workers

222
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,930
together makes both better, and
we'll talk about that later on.

223
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,050
But we're going to focus
on the range of production

224
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,590
where this is true.

225
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,880
Think about production functions
as being non-monotonic,

226
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
they can go up and down.

227
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,005
But we're going to focus
on the range of production

228
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:49,370
where this is true, where
the next worker is not

229
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,760
as productive, OK, because
eventually that's going

230
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,080
to be true for every firm.

231
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,970
And why is that
going to be true?

232
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,900
Because we're holding
capital fixed.

233
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,150
The reason eventually workers
will get less productive

234
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,483
is because there are only so
many machines and buildings

235
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:06,740
they can work in.

236
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,690
The classic example we
think is the example

237
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,140
of digging a hole
with one shovel.

238
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,750
You've got one worker
digging a hole.

239
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,790
She can do a certain
amount of effort.

240
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,920
Then a second
worker comes along.

241
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,728
She can add value.

242
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:20,520
The first can rest.

243
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,978
They can trade off,
and maybe she's

244
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:24,275
almost as productive,
or probably not quite.

245
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:26,150
Then the third worker,
and the fourth worker.

246
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,410
By time you have
six workers, they're

247
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,202
mostly just standing
around because there's

248
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:30,407
only one shovel.

249
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:32,240
Now, each one's more
productive because they

250
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,080
can help you optimize the
shift and get rest and stuff,

251
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,580
but the truth is, clearly the
sixth worker's less productive

252
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,600
the fifth worker given
there's only one shovel.

253
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,320
So the key to understanding
the intuition of diminishing

254
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,073
Marshall practice to
remember that there's

255
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,240
a limited amount of capital.

256
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,190
There is a fixed
amount of capital.

257
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,760
So if there's a given building
and you've got 1,000 workers

258
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,510
and you try to shove
the 1,001st in there,

259
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,760
he's not going to do a
whole lot of good, OK.

260
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,900
So marginal product of
labor comes from the notion

261
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,610
that there's a fixed
amount of capital,

262
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,460
so each additional worker
does less and less,

263
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,310
adds less and less to
the production, OK.

264
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,197
That's the intuition
for diminishing

265
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:09,280
marginal product of labor.

266
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,000
And that's pretty much it
for short run production.

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,120
That's sort of what
you've got to know.

268
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,400
The more interesting
action comes when

269
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,811
we go to long run production.

270
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,810
That gets more interesting
because now, you

271
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,635
have an optimization decision
over labor versus capital.

272
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:33,010
In the short run,
you just decide

273
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,570
how many workers to hire.

274
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,640
In the long run, now
you're back to the kind

275
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,440
of utility framework we used.

276
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,360
We had to trade off
pizza and cookies.

277
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,120
Now, you get to trade
off workers and machines.

278
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,430
Now you own the firm.

279
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,700
You're going to own it forever,
OK, and you get to trade off.

280
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,520
You get to think about
workers versus machines.

281
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,780
So now, you're going to have
to make a decision on that.

282
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,000
And that decision
is going to be,

283
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,760
just as your decision of how
to trade off cookies and pizza

284
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,060
is driven by utility
function, your decision

285
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,820
about whether to employ workers
or machines it's being driven

286
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,930
by your production function.

287
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,190
So make life easy.

288
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,950
Let's start a
production function that

289
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,770
looks just like the utility
function we're using, q

290
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,100
equals L times k.

291
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,412
Familiar form.

292
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:22,620
Before, we said how happy
pizza and cookies made you.

293
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,680
It was the square root
of pizza times cookies.

294
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,340
Now we're going to say how
many goods you can produce

295
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,130
is the square root of
capital times labor.

296
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:37,470
OK, and figure 5-1 shows
you what that delivers

297
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,750
in terms of graphically.

298
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,900
Just as to graphically
represent utility,

299
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,700
we graft indifference curves,
to graphically represent

300
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,300
production, we are going
to graph isoquants.

301
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,670
Isoquants are like firm
indifference curves,

302
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,003
but once again, they're
sort of more tangible.

303
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:02,170
An indifference curve is
this weird, intangible idea

304
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,140
of points along which
are indifferent.

305
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,740
And isoquant's a tangible thing.

306
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,110
It's the combinations
of capital and labor

307
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,100
that produce the same
amount of output, OK.

308
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,790
So for any given
production function,

309
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,100
there's different combination
of capital and labor

310
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,690
that produce the same
amount of output.

311
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:25,010
So for example, in our
example, two units of capital

312
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,300
and two units of labor
produces two units of output.

313
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,520
Four units of capital
and one unit labor

314
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,255
also produced two
units of output,

315
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:36,670
so they would be on
the same isoquant.

316
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,190
They're this combinations
of inputs that deliver

317
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,900
the same level of output, OK.

318
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,680
And isoquants, all the stuff
we learned about indifference

319
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,530
curves apply here.

320
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,120
More is better, so
further out is better.

321
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,210
They can't cross, OK.

322
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,192
And they slope downwards.

323
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:57,650
All the set of things we learned
about indifference curves,

324
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,790
that same set of
intuitions applies here.

325
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,930
The difference
with production is

326
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,980
it's more plausible to
have extreme cases, OK.

327
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,940
So let's consider
two extreme cases.

328
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,680
Let's first consider
the case of inputs

329
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,080
that are perfectly
substitutable, so

330
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,680
like a Harvard graduate
and a Beanie Baby, OK,

331
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,070
perfectly substitutable inputs.

332
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,370
Those are goods where the
production function would be

333
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,920
of the form, q equals L plus k.

334
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,610
That's perfectly
substitute because you're

335
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,860
indifferent between the unit
value and the unit value.

336
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,380
They're perfectly substitutable.

337
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,780
So you can see that
in figure 5-2a,

338
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,510
I do x and y instead of L and
k, but it's the same idea.

339
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,920
If there's two inputs, x and
y, then with that production

340
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,420
function, a perfectly
substitutable,

341
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,630
that would lead to
linear isoquants.

342
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,550
Perfectly substitutable inputs
will lead to linear isoqaunts

343
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,230
with a slope of minus
1, you're perfectly

344
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,370
indfiferent between one or
the other at all levels.

345
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,673
At any point in time, you're
indifferent between 1 more

346
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:12,840
unit of x and 1 more unit
of y, 1 more unit of labor

347
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,220
and 1 unit of capital, OK.

348
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,410
At the other extreme would be
perfectly non-substitutable

349
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:28,910
inputs, inputs where you
can't produce one more unit

350
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,510
without one of each input, OK.

351
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,690
That would look
like figure 5-2b.

352
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,260
We call this a Leontieff
production function.

353
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,300
A Leontieff
production function is

354
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,350
one where there's
non-substitutable inputs, where

355
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,010
the production function
is the min of x and y,

356
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,560
that one more unit
of y does you no good

357
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,080
unless you also get
one more unit of x.

358
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,020
So what's an example?

359
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,645
What's a real world example of
a Leontieff production function?

360
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,040
What's a good which would
have non-substitutable inputs?

361
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,119
We'd need at least one of each.

362
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,240
Yeah.

363
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,030
AUDIENCE: If you have like
programmers and computers,

364
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,870
[INAUDIBLE].

365
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:16,470
JONATHAN GRUBER: Programmers and
computers, that's a good one.

366
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,230
AUDIENCE: It's like, you
need like a right shoe.

367
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,099
JONATHAN GRUBER: You need a
right shoe and a left shoe.

368
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,660
That's a classic
example I would use.

369
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,540
Cereal and cereal boxes
stuff like that, you know,

370
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,040
stuff where you
basically need both.

371
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,860
Shoes are the sort of
classic example, OK.

372
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,770
And that will give you sort of
a Leontieff production function,

373
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,780
OK.

374
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,300
So basically,
those extremes help

375
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,510
you think about what isoquants
are and what they mean.

376
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,840
Now, continuing our
parallel to consumer theory,

377
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,580
what is the slope
of the isoqaunt?

378
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,770
What is the slope
of the isoquant?

379
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,810
The slope of the
isoqaunt, just as we

380
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,730
call the slope of
the indifference

381
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,520
curve the marginal rate of
substitution, since we're not

382
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,030
very creative in economics, we
call the slope of the isoqaunt

383
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,950
the marginal rate of
technical substitution,

384
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,370
because it's the same idea,
but now it's technical.

385
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,350
It come from a technical
production function,

386
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,480
not from your preferences, OK.

387
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,580
So marginal rate of
technical substitution

388
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:25,190
is the slope of the isoquant,
or delta k over delta L.

389
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,160
And as with indifference
curves, that slope

390
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,610
varies along the isoquant.

391
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:37,260
So we can see that
in figure 5-3, OK.

392
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,230
Figure 5-3 is once again drawn
for our production function,

393
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:47,540
q equals square
root of k times L.

394
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,260
So let's say for example, we
start with one worker and four

395
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,460
machines at point A,
OK, and now we consider

396
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,420
adding a second worker.

397
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,630
Well, at point A,
that second worker

398
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:08,010
is so productive because of
diminishing marginal products,

399
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,510
OK.

400
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,060
You already got four machines,
only one guy to run them.

401
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,518
Like, he's not
doing a lot of good.

402
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,110
So adding a second worker
and two machines helps a lot.

403
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,910
It's not perfectly Leontieff,
but you can get the intuition

404
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,240
that two workers
and two machines

405
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,320
are the same as one
worker and four machines.

406
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,750
You're not better off.

407
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,670
You're the same off.

408
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,193
You have the same isoquant.

409
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:30,110
So the marginal rate of
technical substitution

410
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,550
is minus 2.

411
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,690
That is, one worker
substitutes for two machines,

412
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,530
OK, one worker substitutes
for two machines.

413
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,280
But now, starting from point
B and moving to point C,

414
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,280
it takes two more workers to
substitute for one machine

415
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,780
because, if you go
down one machine,

416
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,060
you need a lot more
workers to make up for it.

417
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,380
So then the MRTS
falls to minus 1/2.

418
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,080
So, going from A
to B, one worker

419
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,060
makes up for two machines.

420
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,100
Going from B to C,
it takes two workers

421
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,810
to make up for one machine.

422
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,630
And that's because of
diminishing marginal products,

423
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,430
OK?

424
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,430
That's because of diminishing
marginal products.

425
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:18,940
OK, indeed, there's a
convenient way mathematically

426
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,490
to relate the marginal rate
of technical substitution

427
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,440
to marginal products.

428
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,810
Think of what the
MRTS is asking.

429
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,760
Think of what we're
asking along the isoquant.

430
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,870
We're saying what combinations
of capital and labor

431
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,730
yield the same output.

432
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,160
That's what we're asking, OK?

433
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,410
So another way to think about
it is what change in capital

434
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,690
plus an equivalent
change in labor

435
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,060
leads to the same
level of output.

436
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,580
So you can ask, well,
the change in labor

437
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,610
times the marginal product
of a unit of labor,

438
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,560
times the marginal product
of a unit of labor,

439
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,280
plus the change in capital times
the marginal product of a unit

440
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,530
of capital, which is the same.

441
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,850
I didn't define marginal
product of capital.

442
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,220
It's the same idea as
marginal product of labor.

443
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,050
It's dq dk is the margin
product of capital.

444
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,350
That equals 0 along an isoquant.

445
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,250
Think about it.

446
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,670
Along an isoquant, the
next unit of labor times

447
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:21,180
how productive that labor is
plus the next unit of capital

448
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,347
times how productive
that capital is

449
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:25,430
equals 0 because you're
staying along an isoquant.

450
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,560
So, if you're taking
away one unit of labor,

451
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,730
if this is minus 1,
and this is plus 1,

452
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,500
then, based along
the isoquant, you're

453
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,840
choosing the point where
the MPL equals the MPK.

454
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,790
Or, more generally, if
you reorganize this,

455
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,230
you get that delta k over
delta L, which is the slope,

456
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,630
equals minus MPL over MPK.

457
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:57,320
And that is the MRTS, OK?

458
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,600
The marginal rate of
technical substitution

459
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,660
is the negative of the ratio of
the marginal product of labor

460
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,040
and the marginal
product of capital.

461
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,648
Once again, should
look familiar.

462
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:11,690
It's just like the marginal
rate of substitution.

463
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,910
It's the negative of
the marginal utility

464
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,130
of the good on the x-axis
for the marginal utility

465
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,010
of the good on the
y-axis, same idea.

466
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,320
I derived it in a slightly
different way here,

467
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,738
but it's the same idea.

468
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:25,280
And it comes from
the notion that you

469
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,920
wanted to stay-- that you're
staying constant production,

470
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,060
as you change labor and
capital along this curve.

471
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,560
Yeah?

472
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
MPK over MPL [INAUDIBLE]

473
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,393
give you the same ratio or no?

474
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,560
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, MPK
over MPL would give you--

475
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,880
I mean, basically,
we're defining

476
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,005
the marginal rate of
technical substitution the way

477
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:49,080
we define--

478
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,810
the way we define the
marginal rate of substitution.

479
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,600
You basically want-- because you
want it to be downward sloping.

480
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,468
If you define that, the inverse
would be upward sloping.

481
00:22:57,468 --> 00:22:59,760
So what we're defining is
the downward-sloping concept,

482
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,380
which is the marginal
product of the good

483
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,560
on the x-axis and
marginal product

484
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,662
of the good on the y-axis.

485
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:04,620
So it's not invertible.

486
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,670
It's not freely invertible.

487
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,590
Yeah?

488
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,007
AUDIENCE: What's
the marginal rate

489
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:11,603
of technical substitution for
a Leontief production function?

490
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,770
JONATHAN GRUBER: Ah, great
question, great question.

491
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,770
So, the marginal rate of
technical substitution,

492
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,730
so let's go back to Leontief.

493
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,640
OK, the marginal rate of
technical substitution

494
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,070
actually sort of depends on--

495
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,870
it sort of depends
on where you are.

496
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,470
It's sort of a
nonlinear marginal rate

497
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,680
of technical
substitution, right?

498
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,130
So, basically, it's going
to very much depend--

499
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,540
depend on where you are.

500
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,790
So, basically, it can be
negative infinity or positive

501
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,082
infinity or 0, depending on
where you are on the curve.

502
00:23:40,082 --> 00:23:42,457
So we'll actually-- I don't
want to give you more on that

503
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:43,640
because this problem may--

504
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,557
I'm not giving anything
away-- could obviously

505
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,010
be a problem set problem.

506
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,177
So I don't want to give
more answers than that away,

507
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,560
but, certainly,
it's going to be--

508
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,100
it's not going to
be constant, OK?

509
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,700
Other questions?

510
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,640
Yeah?

511
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,780
AUDIENCE: It's just
like a line, right?

512
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,280
JONATHAN GRUBER:
The marginal rate--

513
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,863
if the curve is just a line, the
marginal rate of substitution

514
00:24:03,863 --> 00:24:05,220
would be constant.

515
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,330
For perfectly substitutable
inputs, it would be constant.

516
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,117
That's right, just like the
marginal rate of substation

517
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,700
would be constant
if your indifference

518
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,690
curves were linear, OK?

519
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,920
Good questions.

520
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,740
OK, so that's production, OK?

521
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,370
Other questions
about production?

522
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,625
OK, that's the basics,
and we went fast

523
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,000
because, basically,
a lot of it's

524
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,660
just parallel to what we did
with consumer theory, OK?

525
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,800
Now but I want to talk about
two other aspects of production

526
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,460
that we need to keep in
mind as we move forward.

527
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,340
The first and the
fourth topic for today

528
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:54,280
is returns to scale,
returns to scale, OK?

529
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,560
This is what
returns to scale are

530
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,390
asking is what happens to
production when you increase

531
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,310
all inputs proportionally.

532
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,820
So, if you double all inputs or
triple all inputs or whatever,

533
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,110
cut all inputs by 73%,
what happens to production?

534
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,590
So it's not about
K versus L. It's

535
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:20,250
about a scale, a scaling up
or down of the operation, OK?

536
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,860
Now we know, obviously,
if you double inputs,

537
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,420
production will go up.

538
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,860
More is better.

539
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,630
The question is by how much.

540
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,350
So our baseline
we can think about

541
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,810
as what we call a constant
returns to scale production

542
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,070
function.

543
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:45,033
That would be one where f of
2L, 2K equals 2 times f of L, K.

544
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,950
So a constant returns
to scale function means,

545
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,730
if you double inputs,
you double output.

546
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,490
If you double inputs,
you double output.

547
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,770
That's a constant returns to
scale production function.

548
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,380
But you could also
define increasing returns

549
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,460
to scale, where doubling inputs
leads to more than double

550
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,700
the output, or
decreasing returns

551
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,950
to scale where
doubling the inputs

552
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,260
leads to less than
double the output.

553
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,760
So constant returns
to scale means

554
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,640
doubling the inputs leads
to double the output.

555
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,890
Increasing returns
to scale means more

556
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,363
than doubling the inputs more
than doubles the output--

557
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:23,530
I'm sorry, means double the
inputs more than doubles

558
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,750
the output.

559
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,480
Decreasing returns the scale
means doubling the inputs less

560
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,480
than doubles the output, OK?

561
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,310
And that gives you--

562
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,830
that's your definition
of returns to scale.

563
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,427
Now where could these come from?

564
00:26:38,427 --> 00:26:40,510
So increasing returns to
scale, for example, where

565
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,302
could increasing--
that's the world's worst

566
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:45,850
S. Where could increasing
returns to scale come from, OK?

567
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,450
So, for example, one reason
for increasing returns to scale

568
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,200
is that, basically,
as a firm gets bigger,

569
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,370
it might learn to specialize.

570
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:56,080
So maybe a firm with two
workers and two computers,

571
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,580
and you double, and you get
four workers and four computers,

572
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,710
and then you could
specialize the tasks more.

573
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,960
And each worker is more
efficient in their specialized

574
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,040
task.

575
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,302
That could lead to
increasing returns to scale.

576
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:07,760
That's an example
of something that

577
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,430
could lead to increasing
returns to scale.

578
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,530
Decreasing returns to scale
could come through something

579
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,185
like difficulty of coordination.

580
00:27:15,185 --> 00:27:17,310
Maybe, when I've got two
workers and two computers,

581
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:20,160
I can keep an eye on them and
make sure they don't slack off.

582
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,540
But, with four workers
and four computers,

583
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,998
there's more slacking
off because I

584
00:27:22,998 --> 00:27:25,060
can't keep an eye
on them all the time

585
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,790
and more so with 8
and 16, et cetera.

586
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,456
Yeah?

587
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:30,360
AUDIENCE: So, when--
I have to ask,

588
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,010
why is doubling the inputs
greater than two times

589
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,773
the outputs?

590
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:37,190
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, so,
basically, doubling the input--

591
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,070
so, when I move to two
workers and two computers

592
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,530
to four workers
and four computers,

593
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,173
I more than double my output.

594
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:43,840
And that's because
maybe they specialize

595
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,915
and get more productive.

596
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:50,620
AUDIENCE: Oh, so f of L, K
equals the original output.

597
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,310
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, so,
well, it's one function.

598
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,880
f of L, it's literally
one function.

599
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,463
It's literally-- so
I'll write it out.

600
00:27:56,463 --> 00:27:59,590
It's literally saying
doubling my inputs leads

601
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,490
to more than twice
what I get with just--

602
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,630
without doubling
the outputs, OK?

603
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,542
Is that another way
to think about it?

604
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:08,504
Yeah?

605
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:10,800
AUDIENCE: So, when we're
talking about the returns

606
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,430
of our-- our return
to scale, is that

607
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,615
how much product
is being produced

608
00:28:16,615 --> 00:28:17,990
or how much profit
is being made?

609
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,560
JONATHAN GRUBER:
How much product.

610
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,435
We're only-- we haven't
gotten to profit yet.

611
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:22,203
We're only talking
about quantity.

612
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:23,620
We're only talking
about quantity.

613
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,960
f is-- remember,
f is the function

614
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,880
that translates inputs to q.

615
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,883
Yeah?

616
00:28:29,883 --> 00:28:31,300
AUDIENCE: Are
things intrinsically

617
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,310
like increasing return
to scale functions

618
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,240
or decreasing return
to scale functions?

619
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,840
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Well, great question.

620
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,070
So what do you think?

621
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,920
What's the right answer?

622
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,850
What do we think in reality?

623
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,570
AUDIENCE: I mean,
like, perhaps, maybe

624
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,800
there could be ways
to shift it or not.

625
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,140
Like, going back to the
whole example you gave about

626
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,015
decreasing-- like, if
there's more computers,

627
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:50,963
people can start slacking off--

628
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,755
if he set like-- if
you set some parameters

629
00:28:52,755 --> 00:28:56,705
or like you deactivated social
media on those computers

630
00:28:56,705 --> 00:28:58,080
that they couldn't
go on Facebook

631
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,730
when like you weren't
watching them,

632
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,065
you could make them be
more productive per se.

633
00:29:02,065 --> 00:29:03,940
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
it's a great question.

634
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,870
Let's start by looking
at figure 5-4 and show

635
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,100
some examples of what we
think about like decreasing,

636
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,267
increasing returns to scale.

637
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:15,722
So figure 5-4 has some examples
of the kind of industries

638
00:29:15,722 --> 00:29:18,180
people think are potentially
decreasing, increasing returns

639
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,010
to scale, OK?

640
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,550
So, for example, we think
the production of tobacco

641
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,250
is a decreasing returns
to scale activity.

642
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,110
That is you're kind
of farming tobacco.

643
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,860
You're growing it.

644
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,000
You're producing it.

645
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,460
Then, if you kind
of double it up,

646
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,550
there's still a certain amount
of land you're working on.

647
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,400
You can't-- there's still sort
of a certain amount of crop.

648
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,108
You're not going to
produce twice as much

649
00:29:40,108 --> 00:29:42,440
by having twice as many
threshers and workers,

650
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,430
whereas, maybe something
like producing primary metal,

651
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,563
OK, you could basically maybe
work a lot more efficiently

652
00:29:49,563 --> 00:29:51,230
by having more machines
and more workers

653
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,600
together producing that metal.

654
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,430
So what is the right answer?

655
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,100
The right answer
is we don't know,

656
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,640
but the one thing we do know
is there can never be forever

657
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,410
increasing returns to scale.

658
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,910
And why is that?

659
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,720
Well, at least, we used to
think this maybe 15 years ago.

660
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,220
Why is that?

661
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,690
Why can there-- what
would happen in an economy

662
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,080
if a firm had forever
increasing returns to scale?

663
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,580
Yeah?

664
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,840
AUDIENCE: You'd get a monopoly.

665
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,548
JONATHAN GRUBER: It
would own the economy

666
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:21,130
because, the bigger I got,
the more productive I'd get.

667
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,980
So I would just eventually
grow and own the whole economy.

668
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,030
Now, actually, that
may be happening.

669
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,600
So maybe it's not as weird
as we thought it was 15--

670
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,740
maybe Google and the big
five have increasing returns

671
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,790
to scale.

672
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,340
But, eventually, we think
returns to scale must decrease.

673
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,715
We think your
scale of production

674
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:40,730
must get so unwieldy
that doubling it

675
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,660
means you just can't
manage it as effectively.

676
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,623
Eventually, we think returns
to scale must decrease.

677
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:48,290
That's sort of the
one sort of principle

678
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,750
we have that we don't know--

679
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,480
we think, generally, probably,
in the life cycle of firms,

680
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,312
returns to scale are probably
increasing and then decreasing.

681
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,770
But we don't know
where it happens.

682
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,780
And, certainly, companies
like Google and Amazon

683
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,405
are showing us that
point of decreasing

684
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:05,830
may happen a lot later
than we thought, OK?

685
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,230
And that's because I think
what we didn't account

686
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,250
for in our traditional
producer theory

687
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,440
is networks, the
fact that networks

688
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,533
get ever more productive.

689
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:16,450
We always thought about
buildings and workers,

690
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,060
and there's a limit to how
productive they can get.

691
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,143
But networks, by bringing
in more and more people,

692
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:21,720
can get ever more productive.

693
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,210
But, at some point, we think
these things have to decrease.

694
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,800
At least, we
traditionally thought so,

695
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,650
but maybe, in 10 years when
Google owns everything,

696
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,130
I'll change my tune, OK?

697
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,140
But that's sort of the
one sort of rule of thumb

698
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,485
we have in thinking
about this, OK?

699
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:36,610
Other questions about that?

700
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,880
OK, let's talk about
the last topic then,

701
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,650
which is productivity,
how this stuff

702
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,000
all matters in the real world.

703
00:31:52,573 --> 00:31:54,240
So we're going to
come back next lecture

704
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,690
and come back to maximizing
profits and all that stuff,

705
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,190
but I want to sort
of step aside now

706
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,430
and ask why does
this all matter.

707
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,430
And, to do so,
let's step way back

708
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:10,050
to the original dismal
scientist, Thomas Malthus.

709
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:18,170
Thomas Malthus in 1798
wrote a book, which said--

710
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,682
which was really
pretty depressing.

711
00:32:20,682 --> 00:32:23,140
He said, look, let's think
about how basic economics works.

712
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,240
Now he didn't do the math.

713
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,460
This is pre-math.

714
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,810
So let's get the
basic intuition.

715
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,860
Think about the
production of food.

716
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:36,950
OK, the production of food has
two inputs, labor and land.

717
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,380
There's workers, and then--
you know, there's machines,

718
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,350
but they're pretty
simple machines.

719
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,590
OK, you sort of till the
land, and there's land.

720
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,320
Well, in the long run--

721
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,820
in the short run,
labor is variable.

722
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,410
In the long run,
labor is variable.

723
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,210
But land is never variable.

724
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,700
Land is a forever fixed input.

725
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,790
There's no long run.

726
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,030
Unless we discover a
new planet, there's

727
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:02,210
no long run over which
land is variable.

728
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,850
What that means is that there
will be ever diminishing

729
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,330
marginal product to farming.

730
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,880
He didn't say it this way, but
this was sort of his intuition

731
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,220
that more and more
workers will try to cram

732
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,510
on a given acre of land.

733
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,868
Each additional worker
can only do so much.

734
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,410
And, eventually,
the marginal product

735
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,110
will be diminishing, OK?

736
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,740
The result is that productivity
will fall, the marginal product

737
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,930
of labor, when each additional
worker will be less and less.

738
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:31,345
And, as a result, we'll
starve because, basically, we

739
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:32,970
have all these people
looking for work.

740
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,570
There's nothing to do because
only a certain amount of land.

741
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,660
They won't have anything
to do, and, eventually,

742
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,770
they'll starve.

743
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,420
So Malthus actually
predicted we would

744
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,560
see cycles of mass starvation
through history, fun guy

745
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,680
to have at a party.

746
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,268
OK, he'd basically say we're
going to get overpopulated.

747
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:49,560
These guys will have nothing
to do because there's only

748
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,910
so much land they can work on.

749
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,140
They'll die off.

750
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,900
We'll eventually grow
overpopulated again.

751
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,950
We'll get these cycles
of mass starvation.

752
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,630
That was his prediction.

753
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,260
Now, since he wrote that
book, world population

754
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,690
has increased about 1,000%.

755
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:08,370
And, yet, we're
fatter than ever.

756
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,409
I'm not saying food
deprivation isn't

757
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,659
a problem around the world,
but, certainly, the world

758
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:17,830
is much better fed that
it was in 1798, OK?

759
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,000
What did Malthus miss?

760
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,440
What did Malthus miss?

761
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,414
What did we get wrong?

762
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:24,312
Yeah?

763
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,979
AUDIENCE: The classic
example against it

764
00:34:25,979 --> 00:34:27,745
is like he didn't
account for innovations.

765
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:30,120
JONATHAN GRUBER: He didn't
account for innovation or what

766
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,940
we call productivity--

767
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,871
productivity, or you can
also call it innovation--

768
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,360
and neither have we so far.

769
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,040
We have written production
functions of the form q

770
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,630
equals f of L and K, but,
in reality, the production

771
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:57,100
function is actually q
equals A times f of L and K,

772
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,680
maybe A of t, A sub t.

773
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,980
And that's a production factor
that, basically, for a given

774
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,583
amount of labor and capital,
as you get more productive,

775
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:07,750
you can produce more things.

776
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,330
The production function
itself changes.

777
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:14,630
You get more productive
over time, OK?

778
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,390
In agriculture,
how did we do this?

779
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,420
Well, we did it in lots of ways.

780
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,310
We invented cool new ways to
harvest the crop, tractors.

781
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,480
We invented fertilizer,
chemical fertilizer.

782
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,090
We invented
seed-resistant crops.

783
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,730
We invented lots of things
that Malthus didn't see coming.

784
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,850
So, as a result, even though the
land is just as fixed as it was

785
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,308
in Malthus' time-- we still
haven't discovered a new planet

786
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:40,360
we can farm on--

787
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,080
we produce a lot more food
because of the factor A.

788
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,160
The production function
itself has changed.

789
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,110
We've become more productive.

790
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,460
So productivity
is the factor that

791
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,980
allows us-- or innovation
is the factor that

792
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,790
allows us to produce more
and more with a given

793
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,170
amount of inputs.

794
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,320
So, actually, food consumption
per capita is rising.

795
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,420
Since 1950, food consumption per
person in the world is up 40%,

796
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,370
OK?

797
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,080
So, while we have starvation,
and it's terrible, it's up.

798
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,570
One side note, some
of you may have

799
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:20,118
heard of a very famous
economist named Amartya Sen.

800
00:36:20,118 --> 00:36:21,660
He's a Nobel Prize
winning economist.

801
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,510
His biggest-- one of
his main contributions

802
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:28,440
was he studied famines,
and he said famines are not

803
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
a technological problem.

804
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,380
He said there's never
been in history a famine

805
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,940
in a democracy.

806
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,370
No democratic nation
has ever had a famine.

807
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,080
Famines are not
about technology.

808
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,028
Famines are about
politics and corruption

809
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:42,070
and the things that get
in the way of proper food

810
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,650
distribution.

811
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,950
So really we have
enough food, OK?

812
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,720
The food is there.

813
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,470
Malthus was wrong.

814
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,220
This is not just
true in agriculture.

815
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,750
It's true all over the world.

816
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,600
Let's look at car production,
one of most famous examples,

817
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,790
OK?

818
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,150
Cars have been around
since the late 1800s, OK?

819
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,400
And they're basically-- when
cars were first invented,

820
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,320
they were essentially
craftsmanship.

821
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,960
Someone would sit down and make
a car if you can believe it.

822
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,460
They'd literally
make all the parts.

823
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,730
They'd make a car or a
couple people together.

824
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,330
In the early 1900s,
Henry Ford introduced

825
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,498
the idea of mass production--

826
00:37:22,498 --> 00:37:24,290
it seems sensible now,
but it's not the way

827
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,520
they used to do it--

828
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,060
a series of workers who each did
a discrete task along the way,

829
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,280
constructing a car.

830
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,030
So no worker did a
whole bunch of the car.

831
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,280
Each worker did a
little piece, which

832
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,780
massively led to
increasing returns

833
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,590
to scale by specialization.

834
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,700
He did that, and, basically,
this was radical at the time.

835
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,240
It seems obvious to us now, but
he cut the price of building

836
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,490
a car more than in
half almost overnight

837
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,910
and basically wiped
out all his rivals

838
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,995
through the introduction
of mass production.

839
00:37:54,995 --> 00:37:56,620
Now you might think
that's pretty cool,

840
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,780
but, you know, that's
and old-time story.

841
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,160
But it's not over.

842
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,883
Innovation in car
production continues.

843
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:05,050
The Indian company Tata,
you may have heard of them.

844
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,190
They do a lot of MIT--

845
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,140
they finance a lot
of stuff at MIT.

846
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,030
They have a car called the Nano
that they produce for $2,500,

847
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,950
OK?

848
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,840
It's a tiny car.

849
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,410
It's lighter.

850
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,870
They use extra light materials.

851
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,880
It's smaller because
they do things

852
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,220
like putting wheels on the
extreme outside of the car,

853
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,150
rather than sort of
underneath the car, OK?

854
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,680
And they minimize
the parts that are

855
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
used to make it easily
fixed and interchangeable

856
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,135
with other cars.

857
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,760
So innovation is
going on all the time.

858
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,470
Look at hybrid.

859
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,140
Look at the innovation in the
fuel space with hybrid cars

860
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,840
and electric cars and Tesla.

861
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,360
OK, innovation is
happening all the time.

862
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,502
Now what's key about
this, besides the fact,

863
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:48,960
technically, what this means
is that, when you write-- when

864
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,290
we think about
production-- now we're not

865
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,210
going to talk about this a lot.

866
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,710
We'll assume that there's
constant production functions.

867
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,910
But what that means
technically is,

868
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,620
when we think about
over time production,

869
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,750
innovation is a key factor.

870
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:03,190
But what this means, in terms of
all of us sitting in this room,

871
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,400
is that productivity
innovation is fundamentally

872
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,610
what determines the standard
of living in a country.

873
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:20,190
Our standard of living is
determined by productivity, OK?

874
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:26,395
So, basically, if you
think about us as workers,

875
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:27,853
if we're going to
get richer, we're

876
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:30,310
going to have to
make more stuff, OK?

877
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:34,870
We're going to have to make
more q or more valuable q, OK?

878
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,510
Now, given our amount
of labor, that's

879
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:41,860
either going to happen through
more K, through more capital,

880
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:47,230
or through a faster A,
through faster innovation.

881
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,250
So, ultimately, what determines
our standard of living--

882
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,800
that is what determines
how much shit we have

883
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,350
for a given amount of work--

884
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,560
is going to be how much we
save and how innovative we are.

885
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,960
I'm sorry, back, how
much capital we have

886
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,075
and how innovative we are.

887
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:05,200
Capital it turns out is
going to come from savings.

888
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
I sort of cheated there.

889
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,110
We're going to talk
about that in about--

890
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,100
about maybe 12
lectures from now.

891
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,850
We'll talk about where
capital comes from.

892
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,370
The hint is capital comes
from how much we save,

893
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,140
and I'll explain why that is.

894
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,070
But our standard of
living is determined

895
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,180
of how much capital
we have, which

896
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,597
is a function of
how much we save,

897
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:23,140
but it's mostly determined
by how innovative we are,

898
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,890
how productive we are, how much
more we can produce for a given

899
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,080
level of inputs, OK?

900
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,370
And, if you look at--

901
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,370
if you ask how does
production go up

902
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,680
given an amount of
capital and labor,

903
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,810
we call that total
factor productivity.

904
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,800
That is, conditioning
on all the factors,

905
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,150
how much does
productivity go up?

906
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,960
Now it turns out we have seen
a massive shift in productivity

907
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,030
in the US.

908
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:58,970
From 1947, after
World War II, to 1973,

909
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,890
productivity growth in
the US was very rapid,

910
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,243
about 2 and 1/2% a year.

911
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:05,410
What that meant-- let's
think about what that meant.

912
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:08,050
That meant, not
doing anything else,

913
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,450
working just as hard
as we were working,

914
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:14,145
we could get 2 and 1/2%
more stuff every year, OK?

915
00:41:14,145 --> 00:41:16,020
That's what I mean by
our standard of living.

916
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,350
Literally, it's saying,
working the same 40-hour week,

917
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:25,160
every year, we got 2
and 1/2% more stuff, OK?

918
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,210
However, from 1973
until the early 1990s,

919
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,050
productivity growth slowed
down massively down to about 1%

920
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,840
a year.

921
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,810
It dropped massively, OK?

922
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,610
Now what happened?

923
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,360
Well, one thing that happened
is we started saving less.

924
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,625
K went down.

925
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:47,750
K is driven by savings,
and we started saving less.

926
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,760
We save a lot less
than other nations.

927
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,423
But, in fact, that's
not much of it

928
00:41:52,423 --> 00:41:54,090
because, even though
we don't save much,

929
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,150
productivity jumped
again in the--

930
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,520
about from 1995 to
2005, productivity

931
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,890
jumped again and went up again
to about 2 and 1/2% a year.

932
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,250
And, essentially, we felt,
ah, this is the IT boom.

933
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,410
OK, computers were
around since the 1970s.

934
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,670
And, throughout the late
1980s and early 1990s,

935
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,462
people kept saying
where's the productivity

936
00:42:14,462 --> 00:42:15,360
gain from computers.

937
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,540
And it appeared to show
up in the mid 1990s.

938
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,195
Suddenly, things got more
productive in the mid 1990s

939
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:24,860
to the mid 2000s, OK?

940
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,260
Productivity rose to
about 2.3% a year.

941
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,230
But, much to our
chagrin, productivity

942
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,690
has stopped growing rapidly,
and it's back to about 1

943
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,130
and 1/2% a year.

944
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,960
So we're not as slow as we were.

945
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,885
So we were-- so, from
1947, '47 to '73, we grew

946
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:44,140
at about 2 and 1/2% a year.

947
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,117
'73 to '95, it was
about 1% a year.

948
00:42:47,117 --> 00:42:48,950
So that meant, with the
same amount of work,

949
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,790
we only got 1% more stuff, OK?

950
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:56,330
'95 to '05, we went
up to about 2.3%.

951
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,860
We jumped back up.

952
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,727
But, since '05, we're
down at about 1.5%,

953
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:04,310
so better than we
were at our minimum,

954
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:09,850
but not nearly as high as
we were at our peak, OK?

955
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,540
So, basically, this raises
three key questions.

956
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,504
Yeah?

957
00:43:13,504 --> 00:43:15,640
AUDIENCE: How is that
productivity measured?

958
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,140
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Oh, great question.

959
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,560
So, basically, we look
at, essentially, a way--

960
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,388
roughly speaking,
we look at how much

961
00:43:22,388 --> 00:43:24,430
stuff gets produced given
how many hours of labor

962
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,380
there are submitted
to the economy.

963
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,760
Roughly speaking, we say
how much do people work.

964
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,802
How much stuff gets made?

965
00:43:28,802 --> 00:43:30,830
Boom, that's productivity,
nothing super fancy.

966
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:31,330
Yeah?

967
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,240
AUDIENCE: I might
have missed it,

968
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,520
but what does TFP stand for?

969
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,312
JONATHAN GRUBER: Total
factor productivity.

970
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,365
That's productivity
controlling for capital.

971
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,740
But the productivity
numbers here

972
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,157
are not total
factor productivity.

973
00:43:40,157 --> 00:43:42,710
They're just labor productivity,
allowing capital to change.

974
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:43,210
Yeah?

975
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:45,835
AUDIENCE: You said that K would
decrease when people save less.

976
00:43:45,835 --> 00:43:48,290
But, if you save less, isn't
your spending someone else's

977
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:48,840
likely [INAUDIBLE]?

978
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,210
JONATHAN GRUBER: You know what?

979
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,380
I don't want to go there.

980
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,030
We're going to spend a
whole lecture on that.

981
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:52,980
So I don't want to go there.

982
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,000
K depends on savings.

983
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,140
Just take that as
a given for now,

984
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,307
and we'll come back to that.

985
00:43:56,307 --> 00:43:58,710
We'll spend two lectures
on it actually, OK?

986
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,800
Now I want to raise
three questions,

987
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,840
before we go, about
these facts, OK?

988
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,295
The first question is why
didn't the IT revolution

989
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:10,920
and the computer revolution lead
to longer lasting productivity

990
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,950
gains?

991
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:16,290
Why did productivity slow
back down after 2005, OK?

992
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,820
We don't really know.

993
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,340
Folks thought that computers
would be the next Industrial

994
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,330
Revolution.

995
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,955
This was going to be
a-- this was going

996
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:24,930
to transform our lives, OK?

997
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:28,440
It looks like what it mostly did
is transform how we watch porn,

998
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,700
OK?

999
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:34,020
And, basically, it looks like,
in terms of productivity,

1000
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,020
it did not actually
change things that much.

1001
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,043
And we don't quite know why,
but it is still a bit worrisome

1002
00:44:40,043 --> 00:44:42,210
that, in terms of the long
run, that, in some sense,

1003
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,621
there wasn't longer lasting
gains from innovation.

1004
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:48,788
If it's a question about
porn, I'm not answering it.

1005
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:51,180
[LAUGHTER]

1006
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,430
AUDIENCE: Maybe with like
how, if you pull more people

1007
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,508
into like a team,
working on team projects,

1008
00:44:55,508 --> 00:44:58,050
the rate at which the project
is worked on tends to decrease.

1009
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,920
JONATHAN GRUBER: You know,
there's lots of theories.

1010
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,470
We could hypothesize
all day about why it is.

1011
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,845
I'm just going to
state the facts

1012
00:45:02,845 --> 00:45:05,870
and say that it's disappointing.

1013
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:10,030
And we need to figure
out what to do about it.

1014
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:14,760
The second question this raises
is how do we spend increases

1015
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,480
in productivity.

1016
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,840
What do I mean by that?

1017
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,590
What I mean by
that is, if there's

1018
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,750
an increase in
productivity of 2 and 1/2%,

1019
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,420
that means we have 2
and 1/2% more stuff

1020
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,250
for the same amount of work.

1021
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,410
But why do we have the
same amount of work?

1022
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:31,490
Another way to say that is
we can work 2 and 1/2% less

1023
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,335
and have the same amount of
stuff, roughly speaking, OK?

1024
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,710
So I have assumed we work the
same, and we get 2 and 1/2%

1025
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,690
more stuff, but why is
that the right answer, OK?

1026
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:44,510
And, in fact, the US and
Europe, since World War II,

1027
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,390
have taken very different
paths in this dimension.

1028
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,770
In the US, we've taken
all our productivity

1029
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,760
and put it into cooler stuff,
and we work harder than ever.

1030
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,800
In Europe, they work less hard.

1031
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,980
I mean, starting jobs in Europe
have six weeks vacation, OK?

1032
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,007
Nothing gets done in
August in Europe, OK?

1033
00:46:02,007 --> 00:46:04,090
They've said-- and, you
know, if you go to Europe,

1034
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,398
it's a little bit
more rundown, OK?

1035
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:08,190
It's not quite as
gleaming and cutting edge

1036
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:10,395
as the US in many places, OK?

1037
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:13,020
Basically, Europe has decided to
take some of that productivity

1038
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,268
increase and put it
into more leisure time.

1039
00:46:15,268 --> 00:46:17,310
We've decided take all
that productivity increase

1040
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:21,420
and put it into better
phones and gadgets, OK?

1041
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,740
So the question is who's right.

1042
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,700
We don't know.

1043
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,980
But the important point is
that's an open question.

1044
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,030
Just because we're
more productive

1045
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,470
doesn't mean we should
just consume more stuff.

1046
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,928
There's an open question of
how you spend your productivity

1047
00:46:30,928 --> 00:46:32,185
gains.

1048
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:34,060
And then there's the
final question and maybe

1049
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,010
the most important, which
is who actually gains

1050
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:40,510
from productivity increases.

1051
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:46,050
So, from 1947 to 1973,
productivity went up 2.5%,

1052
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,480
and virtually every
group in society

1053
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,340
saw their incomes go
up 2 and 1/2% a year.

1054
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,070
Since 1973, on average,
productivity growth

1055
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:58,130
has been about 1.5%,
1.6% on average.

1056
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:02,150
You average these three
series, about 1.6%.

1057
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,760
And average incomes
have only gone up 0.4%.

1058
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,010
So productivity
has gone up 1.6%,

1059
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,470
but average income
has only gone up 0.4%.

1060
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:14,000
The difference is
the gains have all

1061
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,960
gone to the top of the
income distribution.

1062
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,800
So, basically, virtually all
of the gains from 1973 until

1063
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,050
a couple of years ago--
it's started to get better--

1064
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,690
essentially, the
bottom 80% of people

1065
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,210
saw no improvement of
their standard of living

1066
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,687
over a 45-year period,
whereas the top 20%

1067
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:31,770
saw a massive improvement.

1068
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:33,605
And, even within
that, the top 1%

1069
00:47:33,605 --> 00:47:34,980
saw a really
massive improvement.

1070
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,770
And, even within that,
the top 0.1% and 0.01%,

1071
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:40,230
et cetera, saw
massive improvements.

1072
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:44,340
So, as a result, in
1995, the richest 10%--

1073
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,400
or the richest 10%
of the population

1074
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,380
earned 15% of the income.

1075
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,700
Today, it's close to
25% of the income.

1076
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,700
It's getting even worse.

1077
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:58,080
Since 2009, if you look
from 2009 to 2016--

1078
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,340
I don't have it updated--

1079
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,840
and you look at
all the money that

1080
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:05,790
was made in society, on net,
all of it went to the top 1%.

1081
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:06,810
What do I mean by that?

1082
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:10,680
The top 99% were, in
2016, in the same place

1083
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,220
they were in 2009, even
though the economy had grown.

1084
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,320
And all the growth
went to the top 1%.

1085
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,360
So we're actually in
an interesting world

1086
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,100
here where productivity
gains by itself

1087
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,440
may not be enough if
we care about what

1088
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,210
it does to the average
standard of living.

1089
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,877
And that leads to a
very interesting set

1090
00:48:26,877 --> 00:48:28,400
of issues around
equity and fairness

1091
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,730
that we'll spend time on
later in the semester.

1092
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,220
But I want to raise that
issue, both that productivity

1093
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,953
gains can be spent in different
ways on goods and leisure,

1094
00:48:35,953 --> 00:48:37,870
and they can be distributed
in different ways.

1095
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:38,800
And those are the
sorts of things

1096
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,467
we need to be thinking
about as we think

1097
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:42,070
about economic policy, OK?

1098
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,520
So let me stop there.

1099
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,010
We'll come back--

1100
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,510
I guess no section
on Friday, right?

1101
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:47,770
It's an MIT holiday.

1102
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:49,650
And we'll come back on
Monday and talk more

1103
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,600
on producer theory.
