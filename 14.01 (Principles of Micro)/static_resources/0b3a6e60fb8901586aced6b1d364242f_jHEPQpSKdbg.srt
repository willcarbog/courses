JONATHAN GRUBER:
Today, we're going

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,480
to continue our discussion
of consumer choice.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,490
And we're going to
talk now about what

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,310
happens when we take that
unconstrained choice we talked

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,270
about on Monday and
impose budget constraints.

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,480
We'll talk about what
budget constraints are.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,470
We'll then come to talking
about how consumers

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,210
make constrained choices.

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,670
And then we'll end with
an example of food stamps.

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,410
So let's start by talking
about budget constraints.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,990
And we'll start by talking
about their construction,

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,970
the construction of
budget constraints.

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,020
So, basically, last
time, we talked

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,270
about the fundamental
axiom of consumer choice

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,690
that more is better.

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,410
So what stops people from
just bingeing on everything?

20
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,910
It's their budget constraint.

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,860
It's their limited resources.

22
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,410
Now, for most of
this course, we're

23
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,580
going to make a simplifying
assumption that your budget--

24
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,680
that is what you spend--

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,020
equals your income.

26
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,360
That is what you earn, OK?

27
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,080
That is there won't be any
savings or borrowing, OK?

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,110
Now that is a
simplifying assumption.

29
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,860
And, indeed, we'll
spend a couple lectures

30
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,110
at the end of the semester
talking about what happens

31
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,780
when people can save or borrow.

32
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,150
That said, this is not
a terrible description

33
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,500
of most Americans.

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,220
The median American household
has $400 in the bank.

35
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,770
So this is not kind of
a terrible description

36
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,530
of the way most people live
their lives in America,

37
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,270
which is what they
earn each week is

38
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,890
what they spend each week.

39
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,605
So that's what we'll do.

40
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:48,730
It also might not be sort
of a terrible description

41
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,195
of your life.

42
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,570
I presume, in college, you're
not doing a lot of savings.

43
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,640
You maybe do a little
borrowing, but not

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,493
a lot of savings or borrowing.

45
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:57,910
So what we're going
to do is we're

46
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,440
going to assume that's
true for you as well.

47
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,570
We're going to assume your
parents have given you

48
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,160
some amount of money to spend.

49
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,760
We'll call it Y. Your income
Y is the amount of money

50
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,740
your parents have given
you to spend for say

51
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,800
the semester or the month.

52
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,530
And, once again, let's say
all you spend your money on

53
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,070
is pizza and cookies, OK?

54
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,100
That's all you want to
spend your money on.

55
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,140
We write the budget
constraint as saying

56
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,830
that your resources,
your income Y,

57
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,980
can be spent on either
pizza or cookies.

58
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,080
And the constraint is
that you could spend it--

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,510
that budget has to be divided
between pizza, where there's

60
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,720
the price per slice of pizza
times the number of slice

61
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,670
of pizza, or cookies.

62
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,370
We have the price per cookie
times the number of cookies.

63
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,420
So p sub p is the price
per slice of pizza.

64
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,510
p sub c is the price per cookie.

65
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,090
P is the number of pizzas, and
C is the number of cookies.

66
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,340
That's your budget constraint.

67
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,520
You can essentially
devote your income

68
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,092
to some combination
of pizza and cookies,

69
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:03,050
but you have to consider
how much they actually

70
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,540
cost in doing that.

71
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,680
I find this easier
to see graphically.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,270
So let's turn to figure 3-1.

73
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,845
Figure 3-1 shows a
budget constraint.

74
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:14,470
So how does the budget
constraint look?

75
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,500
Well, the x-axis is
your income divided

76
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,970
by the price of cookies.

77
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,380
That is, if you decide to devote
all your income to cookies,

78
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,340
then how many
cookies can you have?

79
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,320
Y over pc.

80
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,960
If your income is $100,
and cookies are $10--

81
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,850
that means you're going
to Insomnia Cookies--

82
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,660
then you can only have
10 cookies, et cetera.

83
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,210
Likewise, the
y-intercept is the income

84
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,460
divided by the price of pizza.

85
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,170
That's how many
pizzas you can have.

86
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,880
The budget constraint
represents--

87
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,410
the budget constraint, the
slope of the budget constraint,

88
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,680
is the price ratio, the
negative of the price ratio

89
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,930
because it's a downward-sloping
line, pc over pp.

90
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,560
That is every extra
cookie that you

91
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,310
buy, holding your
income constant,

92
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:15,190
lowers the amount of pizza
you can have by p sub p, OK?

93
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,480
So let's consider an example.

94
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:24,180
Suppose that Y is $96,
that the price of pizza--

95
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,970
it's an expensive
pizza place-- is $12,

96
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,730
and the price of a
cookie is $6, OK?

97
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,480
$12 for pizza, this is like
downtown San Francisco or New

98
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,400
York.

99
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,680
$96 income, $12 for a slice
of pizza, $6 for a cookie, OK?

100
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,180
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,990
Y is-- I wanted to
make Y 72, my bad.

102
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,230
So Y is 72.

103
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,650
Your income is $72, OK?

104
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,400
And you can spend it
on pizza and cookies,

105
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,730
and those are the prices.

106
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,830
Now what that means is,
if you wanted just pizza,

107
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,000
you could get six pizzas.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,880
If you wanted just cookies,
you can get 12 cookies.

109
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,850
And, generally,
the rate at which

110
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,290
you can trade off pizza for
cookies is minus 1/2, OK?

111
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,270
That is every additional
cookie would require giving up

112
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,937
half a slice of pizza, OK?

113
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:22,520
Every additional cookie requires
giving half a slice of pizza.

114
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,010
That's why the slope
would be negative 1/2, OK?

115
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,520
So, basically, we're going to
call the slope of the budget

116
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,250
constraint--

117
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,150
the slope, we are going
to call the Marginal Rate

118
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,720
of Transformation, the MRT.

119
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Last time, we did the MRS, the
Marginal Rate of Substitution.

120
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,690
Now we're going to have
MRT, the marginal rate

121
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,720
of transformation, which is
equal to minus pc over pp.

122
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
Or the slope of the
budget constraint, OK?

123
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,650
That is the marginal
rate of transformation.

124
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,250
Now this class is not alchemy.

125
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,770
We are not literally
transforming pizza

126
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,370
into cookies.

127
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,578
That would be kind of cool,
but we're not doing that.

128
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:08,370
That's somewhere
else at MIT, OK?

129
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,770
But it's effectively
doing the same thing.

130
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,330
What we're doing is, given that
we have a fixed amount of money

131
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,920
and given that we're
going to spend it all,

132
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,920
the more you spend on pizza,
the less you spend on cookies.

133
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,780
So you're effectively
transforming pizza

134
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,700
into cookies and vice
versa because you're

135
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,950
going to spend all your money.

136
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,450
You've got to spend
it on something.

137
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,920
So, the more you spend on one,
the less you get of another.

138
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,337
So, through the
budget constraint,

139
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:34,870
we are effectively transforming
one good to the other.

140
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,610
By having more of one, we're
getting less of the other.

141
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,110
So that's the sense
in which we call

142
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,777
it the marginal rate
of transportation--

143
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:43,450
of transformation.

144
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,660
So, basically, this comes
back to the key concept

145
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,940
we talked about in the very
first lecture, opportunity

146
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,930
cost.

147
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,010
The opportunity cost of a
slice of pizza is two cookies.

148
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,760
Remember, opportunity
cost is the value

149
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,160
of the next best
alternative, OK?

150
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,960
The opportunity cost is
the next best alternative.

151
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Well, here you only have
two alternatives, pizza

152
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,290
and cookies.

153
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,480
So the opportunity cost of a
slice of pizza is two cookies.

154
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,980
And that's the sense
in which you're

155
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,880
transforming pizza into cookies
or cookies into pizza, OK?

156
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,550
Now this seems kind of
abstract, but let's actually

157
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,220
think of an organization
which has taken this principle

158
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,550
to heart to develop the
best method of weight loss

159
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:37,410
in America, which is Weight
Watchers, OK, Weight Watchers.

160
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,460
Now it turns out that
dieting is super hard

161
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,865
and basically doesn't work, OK?

162
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:45,240
There's a large
literature, which

163
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,400
says that people go
on diets all the time.

164
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,800
Then they stop them, and
they gain the weight back.

165
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,460
OK, dieting is incredibly hard
and basically doesn't work, OK?

166
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,080
But a much more
successful approach

167
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,550
has been established
by Weight Watchers.

168
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,050
It's not the only
approach, but it's

169
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,720
been proven much
more successful, OK?

170
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,700
And, essentially, what
does Weight Watchers do?

171
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,060
They set up a budget constraint
and ask you to follow it.

172
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,690
So, for example,
they essentially

173
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,308
assign point values to every
good you might consume.

174
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:14,850
You go on the website,
and everything

175
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,850
in the world you might want
to eat has a point value.

176
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,755
They then ask, well, what
weight are you today?

177
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:22,880
What's your age and gender?

178
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,080
That stuff matters
for weight loss.

179
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,125
And what weight do
you want achieve?

180
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,000
And they say, if you
want to achieve a weight

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,850
loss of x over y
days, then you've

182
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,400
got to limit
yourself to z points.

183
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,169
So, essentially, your
goal is to lose weight.

184
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,240
So we're going to give
you the budget constraint.

185
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,907
We're not going to
tell you what to eat.

186
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:42,550
That's why it's
better than dieting

187
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,300
because, once again,
Adam Smith was right.

188
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,467
People like to have choices.

189
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:47,730
They like to let
choice drive things.

190
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,780
But we are going to
tell you a total budget.

191
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,450
So, for example, vegetables
are like zero points.

192
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,460
Snickers bars are like
six points, et cetera.

193
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,130
They have various
point systems, OK?

194
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,500
So, for example, suppose your
budget is 30 points, which

195
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,440
would be pretty typical, OK?

196
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,570
Suppose you go to
McDonald's for lunch,

197
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,370
and you get a number one.

198
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,470
The number one at
McDonald's is a Big Mac,

199
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,010
which has 14 points, fries,
which have 10 points,

200
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,720
and a Coke, which
has six points.

201
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,280
That's 30 points, and
it's only lunch, OK?

202
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,570
You've blown your whole
budget for the day on lunch.

203
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,420
Now you could just get
depressed and say screw it.

204
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,777
I'll just be fat.

205
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:29,360
But, clearly, looking
around the room,

206
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,050
you guys have not
made that choice.

207
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,800
Or you could look at
the budget constraint

208
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,690
and say, well, what
else can I get.

209
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,270
Well, it turns out you can
get a 10-piece nugget, which

210
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,300
is 12 points, apple
slices, which is one point,

211
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,160
and a Diet Coke,
which is zero points,

212
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,260
for a total of only 13 points.

213
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,015
Now you have 13 points and
plenty of room for dinner.

214
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:49,640
Now, to be honest,
anyone who tells you

215
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,760
that second lunch is as good as
that first lunch is a liar, OK?

216
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,250
I'd much rather a Big Mac and
fries and a Coke than nuggets

217
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,500
and apple slice and Diet Coke.

218
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,440
Give me a break.

219
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,920
But I'd also much
rather have dinner, OK?

220
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,950
So, basically, this lets
you make the trade-off

221
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,470
by imposing a budget
constraint, by setting

222
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,810
relative prices across goods.

223
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,330
The points are like utils.

224
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,520
They're not meaningful.

225
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,255
They're only
meaningful relatively.

226
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:17,950
It lets you set relative
prices across goods

227
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,540
and then it lets
you, essentially,

228
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,210
optimize across those various--

229
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,980
across those various goods.

230
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,170
So budget constraints,
essentially,

231
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,290
by setting up this marginal
rate of transformation,

232
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,054
can help with a lot of
kind of decisions in life.

233
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:36,330
OK, questions about that?

234
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,848
OK, now what happens if we
shock the budget constraint?

235
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:40,390
So we talked about
constructing them.

236
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,550
What about shocking
the budget constraint?

237
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,425
We're going to do a lot
in this class of what

238
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,967
we call comparative statics,
which is, essentially,

239
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,550
making changes in
one thing or another

240
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,780
and seeing what it
does to the system.

241
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,910
So let's talk about shocking
the budget constraint.

242
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,060
Let's start first with
a change in prices.

243
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:04,250
Suppose the price of pizza
goes from $12 up to $18.

244
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,860
This is a really good
slice of pizza, OK?

245
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,700
Well, what happens to
the budget constraint?

246
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,490
Let's look at figure 3-2.

247
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,800
Figure 3-2 shows what happens.

248
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,010
You have your original
budget constraint BC1.

249
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:24,040
The equation of that line is
12P plus 6C equals 72, OK?

250
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,302
The price of pizza and the
number of slices of pizza

251
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:28,510
plus the price of cookies
times the number of cookies

252
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,810
equals 72.

253
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,120
Now the price of
pizza has gone up.

254
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,210
What that's done is that has
pivoted inward your budget

255
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,870
constraint to BC2.

256
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,110
It has flattened the
budget constraint

257
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,200
because the slope,
remember, is the ratio

258
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,310
of the price of cookies to
the price of pizza, right?

259
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,330
That's a ratio.

260
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,520
Well, that ratio
has just fallen.

261
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,050
It used to be a 1/2.

262
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,360
Now it's a 1/3.

263
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,110
Negative 1/2-- well,
it used to be a half.

264
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,735
Now it's a 1/3.

265
00:11:56,735 --> 00:12:00,880
So the slope has fallen from
negative 1/2 to negative 1/3.

266
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,940
So what's happened is you can
still have as many cookies

267
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,350
as you had before.

268
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,690
The y-intercept has
not changed, but you

269
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,440
can have fewer slices of pizza.

270
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,150
That's why it's a pivot
because one price has not

271
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,400
changed, only the other price.

272
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,402
So it's a pivot inward.

273
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,860
The other thing
here, you'll notice

274
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,070
we have all these funny
dots and stuff, OK?

275
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,930
That represents
what has happened

276
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:30,280
to what we call your opportunity
set, your opportunity

277
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,080
set, which is an
important concept, OK?

278
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,900
Your opportunity set is the
set of choices available to you

279
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,440
given your income
and market prices,

280
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,550
the set of choices available
to you given your income

281
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,500
and market prices.

282
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,570
So your opportunity
set initially

283
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,440
was the black dots
plus the red dots.

284
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,140
Now your opportunity
set has shrunk.

285
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,930
Your opportunity set is
now just the black dots.

286
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,900
Given your income,
you can now get

287
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,710
less stuff, same amount of
cookies, but less pizza.

288
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,060
And you are worse off.

289
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,905
Your opportunity set has shrunk.

290
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:14,280
Your opportunity set-- even
though your parents are still

291
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,800
sending you the same check, you
are worse off because you can

292
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,950
now buy less pizza with it, OK?

293
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,495
So that's what happens
to the opportunity set

294
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:26,370
when a price changes.

295
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,990
And, likewise, you
should show to yourself

296
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,540
the same thing will happen when
the price of cookies change.

297
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,040
In that case, you'll
get an increase

298
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,710
in the steepness of the
budget constraint, OK?

299
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,570
But your opportunity
set will still--

300
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,810
your opportunity set
will still shrink, OK?

301
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,560
Now what about-- yeah?

302
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,477
AUDIENCE: Don't we not
care about all the dots

303
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:45,750
below the line, though,
because we're assuming

304
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,130
we're spending all the money?

305
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,100
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's a good point,

306
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,910
and we're going to
come back to that.

307
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,130
We haven't-- we assume they're
spending all their money,

308
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,630
but it's just a way
of representing.

309
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,968
You could think of the line
being lower as the same thing.

310
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:58,760
We care about-- we just
care about the area

311
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,813
because it represents the
set, but you're right.

312
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:02,480
You could just focus
on the line and say

313
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,490
the line is everywhere lower.

314
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,690
So they're worse off.

315
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,380
That's another
way to look at it.

316
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,880
But we like to think
about as a set.

317
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,580
It comes in handy later
for various reasons, OK?

318
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,970
But that's a good question.

319
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,950
Now let's ask about
a second thing.

320
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,660
What if your income goes up?

321
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,180
What if prices are
back to 12 and 6,

322
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,940
but your parents decide
to send you more money?

323
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,952
Suppose your parents--
or send you less money.

324
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:28,160
It turns out you haven't
been paying enough attention

325
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,820
in 14.01.

326
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,812
You're parents are mad.

327
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:30,770
They're monitoring you.

328
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,540
That's why we have
the camera here.

329
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,242
This goes directly to
all your parents, OK?

330
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,470
I'm sort of joking.

331
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,570
And so let's say parents cut
your allowance to $60, OK?

332
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,570
Well, what does that do?

333
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,800
That's in figure 3-3.

334
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,340
OK, in figure 3-3, the
old budget constraint

335
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,180
was that you get
pizzas and cookies

336
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,180
at a price of $6 and $12,
and you could get them

337
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,040
until you spend $72.

338
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,830
Now you can only get
them until you spend $60.

339
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,260
Now what we see is not a pivot
in the budget constraint,

340
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,042
but an inward shift in
the budget constraint,

341
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:07,000
because the relative
price of pizza and cookies

342
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,230
has not changed.

343
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,075
Therefore, the slope
hasn't changed.

344
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,700
OK, the slope is
dictated solely--

345
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,590
you don't do anything
to control the slope.

346
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,560
The market controls
the slope, OK?

347
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,370
But you and your family
control the level,

348
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,180
and the level has shrunk.

349
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,750
So you're pivoting inwards, OK?

350
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,880
And, once again,
now, instead of being

351
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,090
able to buy say 12
cookies and six pizzas,

352
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,850
now you can only buy say
10 cookies and five pizzas.

353
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,400
That's the most you can get, OK?

354
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,310
So, once again, your opportunity
set has been restricted,

355
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,722
but in a different kind of way
through this pivot inward, OK?

356
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,180
So that's how we
sort of manipulate

357
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,222
these budget constraints.

358
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:48,475
And we're going to come
back to that next lecture.

359
00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:49,350
That'll be important.

360
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,935
Yeah?

361
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:51,768
AUDIENCE: So, in looking
at the differences,

362
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:54,210
can like an increase
in the price of pizza

363
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,940
or like a decrease
in your budget--

364
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,032
is it more showing that
like the change in slopes

365
00:15:58,032 --> 00:15:59,490
doesn't really
affect you if you're

366
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,690
like say buying more
cookies than pizza?

367
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,760
But like, in terms of if
your budget as a whole

368
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,910
decreases, then it
affects you overall.

369
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,930
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
a great question,

370
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,370
and we're going to actually
answer that question

371
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,780
next lecture very explicitly.

372
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,370
So hold on to that
question, and we'll

373
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,500
talk about we're going
to compare explicitly

374
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,035
why income changes
differ from price changes

375
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,660
and what are the
underlying mechanisms.

376
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,310
Yeah?

377
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,140
AUDIENCE: How do you
determine your marginal rate

378
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,760
of transformation?

379
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,990
How do determine your--
like say it wasn't just

380
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,780
pizza and cookies.

381
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,500
Like say it was more products.

382
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,785
How would you
determine that value?

383
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:31,410
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Great, great question.

384
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,060
So, as I said, we
always are going

385
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,410
to start with simplifying
assumptions to make life easy.

386
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,260
There's no reason
that this couldn't

387
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,750
be written in three dimensions.

388
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,050
And you'd have
relative marginal rates

389
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,425
of transformation, rates at
which you're willing to trade

390
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:43,703
off various things.

391
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,870
So you could just extend
the math in all dimensions.

392
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,662
It wouldn't add any
richness, and it'd just

393
00:16:47,662 --> 00:16:49,200
make your head spin.

394
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,540
But the basic-- so
all the basic ideas

395
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,350
can come across with
two goods, but it'd

396
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,288
be the same mechanics
with more goods, OK?

397
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:58,830
You essentially, when we get to
the constrained optimization,

398
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,020
you'll essentially have
more first-order conditions

399
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,440
in your constrained
optimization.

400
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
That's the way to
think about it.

401
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,609
OK, so let's-- actually,
that's a great segue.

402
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,349
Let's turn to the
second part, which

403
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:12,430
is how we use budget
constraints and the utility

404
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,109
function we learned about
last time to actually describe

405
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,369
how consumers make choices.

406
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,900
So we're going to take utility.

407
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,869
Remember, I said
last time consumers

408
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:25,630
are going to maximize their
utility subject to a budget

409
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,381
constraint.

410
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:28,089
Well, now we've taught
you about utility.

411
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,900
We've taught you about
budget constraints.

412
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,990
Let's put them together, OK?

413
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,340
How to consume-- how do
consumers put them together?

414
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,360
Well, graphically, the
representation of preferences

415
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,100
was our indifference curves.

416
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,930
That represented
people's indifference

417
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,430
with further out
indifference curves

418
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,660
made people happy, right?

419
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,623
That was last time.

420
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:50,790
So, essentially, what we're
going to ask graphically

421
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,310
is what is the
highest indifference

422
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,490
curve you can achieve
given your budget, right?

423
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,740
We know you want to be that
highest indifference curve

424
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,840
possible by more is better.

425
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,700
So we're simply
going to ask what

426
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,410
is the highest
indifference curve you can

427
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,330
reach given your budget, OK?

428
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,880
So let's consider the same
utility from last time.

429
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,940
Utility is square
root of P times C, OK?

430
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,450
And let's consider the same
budget we wrote down up here--

431
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,370
$72 income, $12 price of
pizza, $6 price of cookies.

432
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,347
And now let's ask where
can you go with that.

433
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:32,430
So let's turn to figure
3-4 and do it graphically.

434
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,390
We'll do it mathematically
in a minute, OK?

435
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,480
So, in figure 3-4, you
have our budget constraint,

436
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,060
which runs from 6
pizzas to 12 cookies.

437
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,650
That's the original
budget constraint.

438
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,940
And you have a series
of indifference curves.

439
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,260
And these indifference
curves, I1, I2, I3, I4,

440
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,950
they all come directly
from this utility function.

441
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,972
So, simply, I've solved
this utility function.

442
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,680
I'll talk about the
math in a little bit,

443
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,850
and you'll do more math
in section on Friday, OK?

444
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,350
But, essentially,
you can solve--

445
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,350
we'll show you--
you'll drive on Friday

446
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,225
how you take this
utility function

447
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:08,810
and literally can draw the
indifference curves from it,

448
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,390
OK?

449
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,570
But, for now, take my word
that these indifference curves

450
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,530
represent this utility function.

451
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:21,173
And what we see is that
point D is the furthest out

452
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,090
indifference curve you
can achieve while still

453
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,070
meeting your budget, while still
meeting your budget constraint.

454
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,730
And, therefore, we say that
the optimum, graphically,

455
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:36,200
is the tangency between
your indifference curve

456
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,210
and your budget constraint is
the optimal constrained bundle.

457
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,210
You see how we brought--

458
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,627
last time, we talked about
further out indifference curves

459
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:45,335
make you happier.

460
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,127
Today, we talked about
the fact that you're

461
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:48,120
limited by your budget.

462
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,870
So we have the furthest
indifference curve

463
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,020
you can get to is going
to be, definitionally,

464
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,750
at the tangent of the
indifference curve

465
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,850
and the budget constraint.

466
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,390
And, once again,
that gives you--

467
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,560
we realize we don't want
to measure utils, but, just

468
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,560
for mathematical, for
mathematical purpose, that

469
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,840
gives utility at the tangency
of square root of 18, OK?

470
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,370
At that point, you are choosing
six cookies and three pizzas.

471
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,650
That is the choice
you are making.

472
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,370
That is the best off you
can get given your budget.

473
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,920
And, to see this, let's
talk about some other points

474
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,170
and why they're not better, OK?

475
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,680
Let's talk about point A.
Why isn't point A better?

476
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,970
Why isn't it better
to have two-- maybe

477
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,880
you just-- maybe you
like cookies a lot

478
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,380
and don't like--
or like pizza a lot

479
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,755
and don't like
cookies that much.

480
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:40,392
How can we say that point
D is better than point A?

481
00:20:40,392 --> 00:20:40,892
Yeah?

482
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:42,870
AUDIENCE: Because point D is
on a higher indifference curve.

483
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,430
JONATHAN GRUBER: It's on a
higher indifference curve.

484
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,290
So point D dominates
point A because it's

485
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,560
a higher indifference curve.

486
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,060
Well, fine.

487
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,327
Same person, by that logic,
why not choose point E?

488
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:53,660
AUDIENCE: It's above the budget.

489
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,520
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
you can't afford it.

490
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,090
So the bottom line is
you can see graphically

491
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,960
why the tangency is
the best you're going--

492
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,330
is the best you're going to do.

493
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,770
OK, likewise, point C
you wouldn't choose.

494
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,660
Point C has the same slope.

495
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,280
It has the same
slope as point D.

496
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,520
In other words, the slope
is minus 1/2 at point C.

497
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,530
You've drew a line tangent
to point C. The slope will

498
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,897
be minus 1/2, just
like it is at point D,

499
00:21:19,897 --> 00:21:21,730
but you wouldn't be
spending all your money.

500
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,350
So you wouldn't choose
that point either.

501
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,330
Yeah?

502
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,435
AUDIENCE: What if you have
just three indifference

503
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:29,310
curves so there is none
that hit the tangent?

504
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,640
Do you just go for one that's
like the most tangent I guess?

505
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,057
JONATHAN GRUBER: We're going
to come to-- we're going to--

506
00:21:34,057 --> 00:21:35,530
well, first of all,
we're not going

507
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,780
to have discrete indifference.

508
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,560
We could have lines, and
the lines could end up--

509
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,068
you could end up lying along.

510
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,610
You could end up lying along a
budget constraint for example.

511
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,460
Or you could have--

512
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,680
you could even have
utility functions,

513
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,700
which just touch a
budget constraint

514
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,090
at one extreme or another.

515
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,730
And we'll talk
about those cases.

516
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,285
Yeah?

517
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:53,680
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
utility function

518
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,010
go through lines and the
budget constraint, right?

519
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,624
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

520
00:21:56,624 --> 00:21:58,240
AUDIENCE: Isn't this just
Lagrange [INAUDIBLE]??

521
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,940
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
let's come to the math then.

522
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,820
OK, let's come to the
mathematical derivation.

523
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,737
So that's the graphic.

524
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:04,460
So let's come to the math, OK?

525
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,150
Now, always a bit
of a tightrope act

526
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,400
when I'm doing math up here on
the board, so bear with me, OK?

527
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,500
But the key thing is the math
of constraint optimization

528
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,450
is all about the
marginal decision.

529
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,260
Remember, it's hard to say
how many cookies you want.

530
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,340
It's easier to say should
I have the next cookie, OK?

531
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,140
It's about constraint
optimization.

532
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,950
And what we want to ask is we
essentially want to compare

533
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,640
how do you feel about trading
off pizzas versus cookies

534
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,690
versus what will the market let
you do in sort of trading off

535
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,220
pizzas versus cookies.

536
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,440
That is the optimum
is going to occur

537
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,770
when we set your marginal
rate of substitution,

538
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:55,221
which, remember, we defined
as minus MUc over MUp, equal--

539
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:57,630
I'm going to get rid of this--

540
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:03,390
equal to your marginal
rate of transformation,

541
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,620
which we defined as
minus pc over pp.

542
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:13,280
And this is the fundamental
equation of consumer choice.

543
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,780
If you understand
this equation, you

544
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,490
can solve virtually
every consumer choice

545
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,410
problem I'll give you, OK?

546
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:23,820
That basically, at the optimum,
the ratio of marginal utilities

547
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,100
equals the ratio prices.

548
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,060
That is the rate at which
you want to trade off pizza

549
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,730
for cookies is the rate
at which the market will

550
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,570
allow you to trade off
pizza for cookies, OK?

551
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,770
Basically, it's saying
the ratio of the benefits.

552
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,500
Think of this as the benefits
and this as the costs.

553
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,928
Think of the MRS
as the benefits.

554
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:47,720
It's what you want.

555
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,820
MRT is the costs.

556
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,170
It's where you're constrained.

557
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,240
You want to set the
ratio of the benefits

558
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,840
equal to the ratio
of the costs, OK?

559
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,660
Now I find it actually easier
to think of it this way.

560
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:04,300
If you just rearrange terms,
you can write it as MUc over pc

561
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,656
equals MUp over p sub p.

562
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:10,810
I like this way of writing
it because I call this

563
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,040
the bang for the buck equation.

564
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,140
What this is saying, your
marginal happiness per dollar

565
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,860
should be equal.

566
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,210
This is sort of the happiness
per dollar spent on cookies.

567
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,740
This is the happiness per
dollar spent on pizza.

568
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,050
And you want those to be equal.

569
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,550
You want the bang
for the-- you want

570
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,380
to put your next
dollar where it's

571
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,040
going to make you happiest, OK?

572
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,020
And so, basically, think of
that as your bang for your buck.

573
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,370
So, for example, suppose
you were in a position

574
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,350
where the MRS was
greater than the MRT.

575
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,393
You're in a position where the
marginal utility of cookies--

576
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:51,810
and I'm getting
rid the negatives.

577
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,830
There's negative on both sides.

578
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,580
So I'm just going to get
rid of the negatives, OK?

579
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,955
The marginal utility of cookies
over the marginal utility

580
00:24:56,955 --> 00:25:02,280
of pizza was greater
than the price of cookies

581
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,280
over the price of pizza, OK?

582
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,640
That is the slope of
the indifference curve

583
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,230
was greater than the slope
of the budget constraint.

584
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,310
This is the slope of
the indifference curve.

585
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,280
OK, this is slope of
the indifference curve.

586
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,290
This is the slope of
the budget constraint.

587
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,045
In absolute value, the slope
of the indifference curve

588
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:22,420
is greater in absolute value
than the slope of the budget

589
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,780
constraint, OK?

590
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,500
That would be true at points
like point A, point A where

591
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,180
you intersect--

592
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,780
where you basically intersect
from above the budget

593
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,510
constraint by the
indifference curve.

594
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,530
So a point like point
A has a steeper slope

595
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,660
of the indifference curve than
does the budget constraint.

596
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,330
What that says is
intuitively-- and, once again,

597
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,280
I want you to understand
the intuition--

598
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,120
the rate at which you
are willing to give up,

599
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,670
the rate at which you
are willing to give up

600
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,820
cookies for pizzas--

601
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,660
I'm sorry.

602
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,485
Let me say it--

603
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:00,610
let me say it a better way.

604
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,120
The marginal benefit to
you of another cookie

605
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,910
relative to another
pizza is higher

606
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,660
than what the market will charge
you to turn pizza into cookies.

607
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,560
Let me say it again.

608
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,373
The marginal benefit to you of
another cookie, which is this--

609
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:19,290
this is how much more
you want the next cookie

610
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,570
relative to how much more
you want the next pizza--

611
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,987
is greater than
what the market is

612
00:26:22,987 --> 00:26:27,300
going to charge you to trade
in your pizza for cookies.

613
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,415
Therefore, you should trade
in your pizza for cookies, OK?

614
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:32,790
So let's say this
mathematically.

615
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:38,010
At a point like A,
point A, OK, you

616
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:42,330
have your marginal
utility for pizza

617
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,180
is the derivative of the
utility function with respect

618
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,690
to the number of
slices of pizza.

619
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,600
It's the marginal utility.

620
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,267
It's derivative of
the utility function.

621
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:59,490
So it's dU dp, which is equal
to 0.5 times C over square root

622
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:04,330
of P times C, OK?

623
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:09,550
And, at point A,
at point A, we had

624
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,200
two cookies and five pizzas.

625
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,120
At point A, P was five.

626
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,370
C was two.

627
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,600
OK, that's true of point A.

628
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,685
So we can evaluate the
marginal utility dU

629
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:22,595
dp, which equals 0.5 times C
over square root of P times C.

630
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:24,220
So that's 1 over the
square root of 10.

631
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,895
That's the marginal utility
of the next slice of pizza.

632
00:27:30,895 --> 00:27:32,270
The next slice of
pizza makes you

633
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,590
1 over square root of 10 happy.

634
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,215
Once again, that
number is meaningless.

635
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:36,690
So we only care
about it in ratios.

636
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,790
So we need the ratio.

637
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,060
So let's do the marginal
utility of cookies.

638
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:48,890
That's dU dC, which
is 0.5 times P

639
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:54,650
over square root of P
times C, which is 2.5

640
00:27:54,650 --> 00:28:00,870
over the square root of 10, OK?

641
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,290
So the marginal utility of pizza
is 1 over square root of 10.

642
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,330
Marginal utility of cookies is
2.5 over the square root of 10.

643
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:14,410
Therefore, your marginal rate
of substitution is minus 2.5.

644
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,110
Remember, marginal rate of
substitution is MUc over MUp.

645
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,430
So your marginal rate of
substitution is minus 2.5.

646
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,292
What does that mean?

647
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:23,750
Can anyone tell me
what that means?

648
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,500
Your marginal rate of
substitution is 2.5.

649
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,333
What does that mean?

650
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,560
That is a meaningful concept.

651
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,700
Utils are not, but that is.

652
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,630
Yeah, say it loudly
so we can hear.

653
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,825
AUDIENCE: You're
willing to trade--

654
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:35,962
you're willing to trade
two pizzas for one cookie.

655
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:37,670
JONATHAN GRUBER: You're
willing to trade.

656
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,790
Exactly, you're willing to
give up 2.5 slices of pizza

657
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,900
for one cookie.

658
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,310
That's what that number means.

659
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,420
And that is a meaningful number.

660
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,020
That's not an ordinal.

661
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,687
That's cardinal.

662
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:47,590
We can use that.

663
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,030
You are willing to give
up 2.5 slices of pizza

664
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,260
to get one cookie.

665
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,870
What is the market
asking you to give up?

666
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,270
How much pizza do you have
to give up to get one cookie?

667
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,160
Half a slice.

668
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,353
You are happy to give up
2 and 1/2 slices of pizza

669
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:06,770
to get a cookie,
but the market is

670
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,010
saying we'll let you
have a cookie for half

671
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,160
a slice of pizza.

672
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,440
So what should you do?

673
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,380
AUDIENCE: Trade.

674
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,713
JONATHAN GRUBER: Eat less pizza.

675
00:29:12,713 --> 00:29:13,780
Eat more cookies.

676
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,890
That will unambiguously
make you happier.

677
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:21,320
And that's why you should move
from point A towards point D.

678
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,640
OK, that's the intuition, OK?

679
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,940
You basically want to
trade pizza for cookies

680
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,210
until these things are equal.

681
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,050
Indeed, I'd like you to go home
and do the same math starting

682
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,810
at point B. If you do the
same math starting at point B,

683
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,280
you'll find the MRS
is much below 1/2.

684
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,410
That is, at that point,
you are happy to give up

685
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,290
tons of cookies to get pizza
because, jeez, you've got 10

686
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,750
cookies and one slice of pizza.

687
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,542
You'd give up tons of
cookies to get pizza.

688
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,375
But the market says you
only have to give up

689
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:57,590
two cookies to get pizza.

690
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,770
So you'll happily do it, and
you move back towards point D.

691
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,890
And that's sort of in a bundle
sort of the intuition and math

692
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,160
and graphics of how we do
constrained optimization.

693
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,900
OK, that is hard
and very important.

694
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,440
Questions about that?

695
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,240
Don't hesitate to ask.

696
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,150
OK, that is hard
and very important.

697
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,880
If you understand
this, you're sort of

698
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,680
done with consumer theory, OK?

699
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,530
This is sort of the core of what
consumer theory is all about.

700
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,110
It's all about
this balancing act.

701
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,220
The whole course
is fundamentally

702
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,010
all about one equation,
which is marginal benefits

703
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,810
equals marginal costs, OK?

704
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,750
Everything we do is going
to be about weighing

705
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,280
the marginal benefit
of an activity

706
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,360
against its marginal costs.

707
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,740
If we take the next
step, what's the benefit?

708
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,818
And what's the cost?

709
00:30:45,818 --> 00:30:47,610
Well, here the marginal
benefit is the MRS.

710
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,260
The marginal cost is the MRT.

711
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,100
We want to set them equal.

712
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,940
And this sort of example
I hope explained why, OK?

713
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,760
So that is how we think
about constrained choice.

714
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,540
Now I want apply it.

715
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:05,240
I want to apply it by looking at
the example of food stamps, OK?

716
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,052
Now food stamps are not actually
called food stamps anymore.

717
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:10,010
When I was a kid, they
were called food stamps.

718
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,560
It's basically a program
the government has

719
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,900
that provides money
for individuals

720
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,640
to buy food if
they're low income.

721
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,330
Essentially, we have in the US
what's called the poverty line.

722
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,950
And I'll talk a lot more about
this at the end of the class,

723
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,408
but the poverty
line is essentially

724
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:29,910
a measure of what's a
minimum level of resources

725
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,560
you need to live in America.

726
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,350
The poverty line for an
individual is about $14,000.

727
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,783
OK, for a family of
four, it's about $28,000.

728
00:31:37,783 --> 00:31:39,450
How you feel about
that number obviously

729
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,440
is going depend on
where you're from.

730
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,180
If you're from Boston,
you'll say that's insane.

731
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,470
If you're from some rural
part of the country,

732
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,630
you think, yeah, that's
poor, but manageable.

733
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,042
OK, we'll talk later
about the poverty line,

734
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:49,250
what's good and bad about it.

735
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,970
But, in any case, if you're
below the poverty line

736
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,790
in America, roughly speaking,
you get help with buying food.

737
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,265
And that comes through a
program we now call SNAP.

738
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:57,640
It used to be
called food stamps.

739
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,480
I've got to update my notes.

740
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,720
Supplemental Nutrition--
I don't know.

741
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,230
I know the N is for nutrition.

742
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,810
OK, so, basically, what
the SNAP program does

743
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,400
is it gives you a debit card.

744
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,490
If you qualify on income
grounds, you get a debit card,

745
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:18,278
and that debit card can be used
to buy food and food only, OK?

746
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:20,570
So you essentially get a
debit card from the government

747
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:24,730
that you can use to buy
food if you're poor enough.

748
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,430
And they give you sort of
a fixed amount every month,

749
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,560
and that amount can be
used to purchase food.

750
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,040
So here's the question.

751
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,740
Why go through this rigmarole?

752
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,678
Why not just give people cash?

753
00:32:35,678 --> 00:32:37,970
This fancy thing, if we want
to give poor people money,

754
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,620
why don't you just
give them money?

755
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,453
And we're going to--

756
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:42,112
I don't want the answer yet, OK?

757
00:32:42,112 --> 00:32:43,820
What I want to do is
show you graphically

758
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,110
how we think about
the trade-off,

759
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,590
and then we'll
come to the answer.

760
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,270
So hold your thoughts.

761
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,940
So let's actually graph how
we think about food stamps.

762
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,070
Let's go to figure 3-5A.

763
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:57,040
And let's start with
a cash transfer.

764
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,780
So here's the setup.

765
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,490
Imagine people start
with an income of $5,000.

766
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,990
That's super poor, OK?

767
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,080
$5,000 is their whole family
income for the year, OK?

768
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,338
And let's say all they can
spend it on is food or shelter.

769
00:33:11,338 --> 00:33:13,380
Remember, as this gentleman
pointed out, in life,

770
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,310
there's more than two goods,
but it makes it a lot easier

771
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,265
to have two goods.

772
00:33:16,265 --> 00:33:17,140
So imagine this case.

773
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,880
Your two goods are
food and shelter.

774
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,260
And, actually, quite
frankly, if you're that poor,

775
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,718
that probably is
the only two goods

776
00:33:21,718 --> 00:33:24,390
you have to-- you can worry
about at that level of income.

777
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,700
OK, it's food and shelter.

778
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,010
So you $5,000 to devote
to food and shelter.

779
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,000
So you have some
original budget line,

780
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,670
which is labeled
there original budget

781
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,700
line, that runs from 5,000
in food to 5,000 in shelter.

782
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,500
And then you can have some of
in between, some along the way,

783
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,110
OK?

784
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,360
Now let's say we give
someone $500 in cash.

785
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,780
Obviously, this graph
is not to scale, OK?

786
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,387
It looks like you're doubling
his income, but it's only $500.

787
00:33:49,387 --> 00:33:51,720
This just sort of makes it
easier, a not to scale graph.

788
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,330
Let's say we give someone-- we
say to them, look, you're poor.

789
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,950
We're going to give
you $500 in cash.

790
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,130
Well, now all we've done
is shift out your budget

791
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,007
constraint from 5,000 to 5,500.

792
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,840
OK, we've shifted out
your budget constraint

793
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,570
from 5,000 to 5,500.

794
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,460
What does that do
to your choices?

795
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,380
Well, consider two
different types of people.

796
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,840
Person y, OK, they used to
be on indifference curve I0.

797
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,447
They used to spend almost
all their income on food

798
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:21,489
and not a lot on shelter.

799
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:23,659
They were probably homeless, OK?

800
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,460
So they spent all
their money on food

801
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,080
and were basically homeless.

802
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,112
Now what do they do?

803
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:30,320
Well, they spend a little
more on food and a lot more

804
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,342
on shelter.

805
00:34:31,342 --> 00:34:33,050
Maybe now they get--
you know, $400 still

806
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,258
doesn't buy you much shelter.

807
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:36,469
They spend a little more, OK?

808
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:39,620
Maybe, a night a week,
they can get shelter, OK?

809
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,719
So, basically,
that's what they do.

810
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,197
That's their constrained
optimization.

811
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:45,739
We're not saying
it's right or wrong.

812
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,072
This is not normative economics.

813
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:48,350
It's positive.

814
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,750
The positive thing is, given
their utility function,

815
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,010
they move from point y1 to y2.

816
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,600
Now imagine someone
like individual x.

817
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,620
They're different.

818
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,703
Their tastes are such that
they don't need to eat.

819
00:34:58,703 --> 00:35:00,480
They just want to have shelter.

820
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,660
So they're up at
point x1 initially.

821
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,610
And you give them
that $500, and they

822
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,680
spend just a little bit more of
it on food and even more of it

823
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,280
on shelter.

824
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,470
They just love
their shelter, OK?

825
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,530
And they're just super--

826
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,780
they're super Weight Watchers.

827
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,430
They don't eat, OK?

828
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,800
So, basically, they
move from x1 to x2.

829
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,780
Once again, not
normative right or wrong,

830
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,230
it's just these are
feasible choices people

831
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,910
could make given the opportunity
set with which they're faced.

832
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,410
And that's what happens when
you give them the $500 in cash.

833
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,960
Questions about what I did
here on this graph alone?

834
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,585
Yeah?

835
00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:33,340
AUDIENCE: Like, even
if like you gave them

836
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,330
money specifically for
food, couldn't they then

837
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,312
just reallocate
their other money?

838
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:39,020
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK,
that's a good point.

839
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,610
We'll come back to that.

840
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,402
That's time out if
you're not a sports fan.

841
00:35:41,402 --> 00:35:45,010
OK, so we will
come back to that.

842
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,480
And, in fact--

843
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,470
OK, but do people
understand what the cash

844
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,610
transfer is, how it works?

845
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,030
OK, now let's go to SNAP.

846
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,040
And let's say, with SNAP,
instead of giving them $500,

847
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,640
we'll give them the debit card.

848
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,610
Instead of handing
them a $500 check,

849
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,470
we give them a debit
card with $500 on it

850
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,390
that can only be used on food.

851
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,280
How does this affect
their budget constraint?

852
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,720
Now we see where budget
constraints start

853
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,910
to get interesting and fun
and the kind of challenges

854
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,118
you're going to face in this
course in drawing budget

855
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:11,983
constraints.

856
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:13,650
The original budget
constraint continues

857
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,940
to be the original budget line
running from 5,000 to 5,000.

858
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,850
The new budget constraint
is this kinked line

859
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,230
that runs from 5,000 on
the y-axis to the point

860
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,680
x2 at 5,000 on the y-axis.

861
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,770
So it starts at 5,000 on
the y-axis, 0 on the x-axis.

862
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,900
There's a flat line that goes
to 5,000 on the y-axis, 500

863
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,048
on the x-axis.

864
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:39,340
And then it slopes down
parallel to the original budget

865
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,830
constraint to 5,500.

866
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,410
Can someone explain to me
why that's the new budget

867
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,210
constraint?

868
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:45,710
Yeah?

869
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,085
AUDIENCE: You can't
spend a negative amount.

870
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:50,697
So you can't spend
like negative amounts

871
00:36:50,697 --> 00:36:52,400
of your non-food-stamp
money on food.

872
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,900
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Exactly, you have--

873
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,247
we are forcing you to
spend at least $500.

874
00:36:57,247 --> 00:36:59,830
Compared to cash, where you can
do whatever the hell you want,

875
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:05,330
we are forcing you to spend
$500 of your money on food.

876
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,848
Coming to the
question back there,

877
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:08,890
it doesn't have to be a
specifically labeled 500.

878
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,390
It can be any 500.

879
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,950
But we're forcing you to
spend at least $500 on food.

880
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,330
Well, what does that
do to your choices?

881
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:21,550
Well, for person y,
it makes no difference

882
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,887
whether they get cash or
whether they get food stamps.

883
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:26,970
Now the person, light blue
shirt, turquoise shirt,

884
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:27,803
asked that question.

885
00:37:27,803 --> 00:37:29,780
Why does it make no difference?

886
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,340
Yeah?

887
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,903
Why does it--
whatever, greenish, I

888
00:37:31,903 --> 00:37:32,820
don't know, yeah, you.

889
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,793
Why does it make no
difference for person y

890
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:36,210
if I give him food
stamps or cash?

891
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,230
AUDIENCE: He's already spending
a lot of his money on food.

892
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,522
So any money he gets he can
just reallocate differently

893
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:42,162
so he can spend
some of the money

894
00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:43,780
he would have used
on food on shelter.

895
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,265
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly, he can
just reallocate his money, OK?

896
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,140
That's exactly right.

897
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,980
So, for person y,
there's no difference.

898
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,378
Look, they're already
spending, what, $4,900 on food.

899
00:37:54,378 --> 00:37:56,170
You give him a thing
labeled $500 for food.

900
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,670
It's not going to
affect their life.

901
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,870
They'll just take 500.

902
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,270
They'll just spend-- they'll
just treat it as $500 more

903
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,010
in cash.

904
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:02,980
They're indifferent.

905
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,460
So nothing affects them.

906
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,920
But what about person x?

907
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,470
Well, person x, remember,
the dashed portion

908
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,740
of this budget constraint is
from the old cash example.

909
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,250
And the dotted
indifference curve

910
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,190
is what they would
have chosen with cash.

911
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,680
Remember, person
x with cash would

912
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,640
have chosen to still spend
less than $500 on food.

913
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,860
Even when you gave
them $500, they still

914
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,680
only spent $300 on food.

915
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,270
So we are forcing them to not
be on their preferred budget

916
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,740
constraint.

917
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:40,420
Rather, we're forcing
them down to point x2,

918
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,420
which is they'll spend the
minimum they can on food,

919
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,670
but the minimum is $500, OK?

920
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,470
We are forcing them
down to point x2.

921
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,420
Now why do I say forcing them?

922
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,600
Why do I know for sure they
are being forced, that they're

923
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,260
less happy at x2 than they would
have been when they gave them

924
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,763
the cash?

925
00:38:59,763 --> 00:39:00,930
How do I know that for sure?

926
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:01,930
Yeah?

927
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,930
AUDIENCE: They're at a
lower indifference curve.

928
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,170
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

929
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,295
Think of it this way.

930
00:39:06,295 --> 00:39:08,170
The fundamental-- one
of the important things

931
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,850
is people always get
to the point that

932
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,798
makes them happiest, OK?

933
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:13,840
We call it the robustness
of economic equilibria.

934
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,882
People get to the point
that makes them happiest.

935
00:39:15,882 --> 00:39:19,050
They want-- they
always before had

936
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:22,175
the choice of spending $500 on
food, and they chose not to.

937
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:24,300
Therefore, if you force
them to spend $500 on food,

938
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,915
they must be less happy, OK?

939
00:39:26,915 --> 00:39:27,790
Think of it that way.

940
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,680
They always could have
spent $500 on food.

941
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,460
They didn't.

942
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,877
Therefore, in
forcing them, you're

943
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:34,220
making them less happy, OK?

944
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,150
So they are worse off, OK?

945
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,500
They are forced to spend.

946
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,090
They'd rather spend
some of that money

947
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,970
and find a nicer place to live,
but we're not letting them.

948
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,300
We're making them buy food, OK?

949
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,870
Do people-- I don't want--

950
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:52,200
I just want to know if people
understand the graphics here

951
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,870
and the conclusions I drew.

952
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,770
OK, now why?

953
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,130
Why are we doing this?

954
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,610
Why would you-- they're
better off with cash.

955
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,860
Why would we force
them to have food?

956
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,760
Yeah?

957
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,660
AUDIENCE: Say
because what makes--

958
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,550
what puts people on the
highest indifference

959
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,660
is just what makes them
happiest, but not necessarily

960
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,202
what makes them like
live the longest

961
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,050
or like have the best
health So, perhaps,

962
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,800
like if you never spend money
on food, and then you die,

963
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,998
that would be really bad.

964
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,290
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK, but,
basically, what you're saying

965
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,940
is you know better than the guy.

966
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,190
Let me-- I'm not accusing you.

967
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:28,320
I'm just saying, look,
if people knew best,

968
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,420
maybe they'd like to just like
have a nice house and die, OK?

969
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,820
If people knew
best, then there'd

970
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,080
be no reason to do this.

971
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,210
The reason to do this is because
we think they don't know best.

972
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,110
So, for example, let's change
the label on the y-axis, just

973
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,750
a small change.

974
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,091
Let's cross out shelter
and write cocaine.

975
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:49,860
[LAUGHTER]

976
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,850
OK?

977
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,640
Well, in that case, maybe
we don't feel so bad

978
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,590
about forcing the guy to buy
food instead of cocaine, OK?

979
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,290
In other words, this a
program which might make

980
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,380
sense if we are paternalistic.

981
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,010
Now we're getting into normative
economics, paternalistic.

982
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,110
If we think that people
won't necessarily

983
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:12,350
make the right decisions
for themselves,

984
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,600
then it may be worth
actually making them

985
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,100
worse off because
they're not worse off.

986
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,370
Their perceived
benefits are worse,

987
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:23,070
but they don't know
what they're doing, OK?

988
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,643
Now you can see why--

989
00:41:25,643 --> 00:41:27,060
I hope you can
sort of immediately

990
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:31,230
see why this concept makes
economists a little nervous

991
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,213
because why do we know what they
want better than they do, OK?

992
00:41:34,213 --> 00:41:35,880
So it makes people a
little bit nervous,

993
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,630
economists a little
bit nervous, and a lot

994
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,320
of people a little bit nervous
to say, gee, maybe they're

995
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,254
just happier doing cocaine.

996
00:41:42,254 --> 00:41:44,462
And how do we know that
that's the wrong way for them

997
00:41:44,462 --> 00:41:45,504
to spend their resources?

998
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:46,025
Yeah?

999
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:46,873
AUDIENCE: Well,
like can't you look

1000
00:41:46,873 --> 00:41:49,330
at it from the perspective of
like this is taxpayer money,

1001
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:49,830
right?

1002
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,562
So then aren't you
also just factoring

1003
00:41:51,562 --> 00:41:54,320
in how the taxpayer wants to
spend their money and then

1004
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,760
their indifference curve
and all their information?

1005
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,740
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
a very good point.

1006
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,448
Now but there's sort
of two points there.

1007
00:41:59,448 --> 00:42:04,650
First of all, if the taxpayers'
goal is to help poor people,

1008
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,190
then why shouldn't you make them
as happy as possible, right?

1009
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,070
If tax-- why am I giving
money to this poor guy?

1010
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,300
Because I'm sad his poor.

1011
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,940
But, what you're saying, I'm
not actually that sad he's poor.

1012
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,930
I'm sad he's not eating.

1013
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,760
If you're really
just sad he's poor,

1014
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,230
then you should give him money.

1015
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,820
If what you're
sad about is, gee,

1016
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,810
I don't like how he's living--

1017
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,300
I don't like his--

1018
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,910
I'm sad he can't have better
food to eat, sad at the place

1019
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:27,410
he lives.

1020
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,540
Then you're starting to
impose your preferences,

1021
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,498
but let's be important.

1022
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:32,876
That's imposing
your preferences.

1023
00:42:32,876 --> 00:42:33,548
Yeah?

1024
00:42:33,548 --> 00:42:35,590
AUDIENCE: I feel like the
indifference curve only

1025
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,570
goes for happiness or
like contentedness,

1026
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,680
but, really, the point
of SNAP isn't really

1027
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,690
with contentedness or
happiness, but rather

1028
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,900
like what would be to a
more sustainable life.

1029
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,483
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, that's a
related point of the taxpayer.

1030
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,900
If the taxpayer
cares about, look,

1031
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,510
we want a healthy
populace that's

1032
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,090
going to live a long time and
be productive and pay taxes,

1033
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,990
then that would be
a reason to do this.

1034
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,560
But, once again, I
want to emphasize,

1035
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,385
OK, this is paternalism.

1036
00:43:00,385 --> 00:43:02,510
If you really just care
what makes people happiest,

1037
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,430
you should give them cash, OK?

1038
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:10,410
So that raises
two questions, OK?

1039
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,760
First of all, first
question-- yeah?

1040
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,035
AUDIENCE: So how about
like negative [INAUDIBLE]..

1041
00:43:17,035 --> 00:43:19,570
Because, for example, if
we pump a lot of money--

1042
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,720
if we allow people to
spend a lot on shelter,

1043
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,345
that's not really
going to help people.

1044
00:43:23,345 --> 00:43:25,530
It would just make the real
estate developers rich.

1045
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,440
And say the amount
of shelter is kind of

1046
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,962
fixed, but like the amount of
food that eaten [INAUDIBLE]..

1047
00:43:30,962 --> 00:43:32,920
So, if we let people
spend more money on food--

1048
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,480
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
yeah, so, basically, that's

1049
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,290
a great question.

1050
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,250
And, in general,
we're going to--

1051
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,660
I'm going to answer a
lot of those questions

1052
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,077
with the same cheat
this semester,

1053
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:41,410
which is we're going to assume
the markets are perfectly

1054
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,190
functioning.

1055
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,183
So there's no-- you're imposing
sort of a market failure.

1056
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:47,350
If there's no market-- once
there's market failures,

1057
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,410
all bets are off.

1058
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,710
But, with no market
failure and no paternalism,

1059
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,390
you'd want to give them cash.

1060
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,000
So this raises an
important question.

1061
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,990
Do food stamps actually
increase food purchases?

1062
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,690
First of all, there's two
reasons why they might not.

1063
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:04,300
Reason one is everybody
could be like y.

1064
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,730
x is sort of a
silly case, right?

1065
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,726
You're going to die if
you eat that little.

1066
00:44:07,726 --> 00:44:09,670
And food stamps
aren't that much.

1067
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:12,100
They're maybe like
$3,000 a year.

1068
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,210
Everybody is going
spend $3,000 on food.

1069
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:18,318
So the first issue is the first
reason why food stamps may not

1070
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:19,860
matter is that, in
fact, everybody is

1071
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,720
spending at least that amount.

1072
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,640
Everybody is like y,
and nobody is like x.

1073
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,700
What's another reason
why it might not matter?

1074
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,030
What's a way people could
get around food stamps?

1075
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:28,530
Yeah?

1076
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,150
AUDIENCE: Buy food with
food stamps and sell it.

1077
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,817
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
they could set up

1078
00:44:31,817 --> 00:44:34,650
a black market where they,
essentially, say, look,

1079
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,272
I only want $2,000 of food.

1080
00:44:36,272 --> 00:44:37,980
The government is
making it worth $3,000.

1081
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,355
I'll buy my extra
$1,000 of food,

1082
00:44:39,355 --> 00:44:41,160
and I'll sell it to
people who do want it.

1083
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,290
And I'll end up still
eating $2,000 worth of food.

1084
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:48,250
So we actually want to know do
food stamps actually increase

1085
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,690
food consumption in practice.

1086
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,410
Are they making a difference?

1087
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:54,850
Well, actually, we've run
an experiment on this, OK?

1088
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:57,070
We're going to talk
in this class a lot

1089
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:00,430
about empirical
results in economics.

1090
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:04,000
This class is mostly going
to be a theoretical class.

1091
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,550
That is we'll talk
about models and ideas.

1092
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,632
But we're also--
since, basically, I'm

1093
00:45:08,632 --> 00:45:10,090
an empirical
economist, we're going

1094
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:13,990
to talk about empirical
economics, which is results

1095
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,938
and testing the
theories we develop.

1096
00:45:15,938 --> 00:45:17,730
Empirical economics,
here's a great example

1097
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:20,890
of empirical economics is we
set up a theoretical model.

1098
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,720
You always want to
start with the theory,

1099
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,550
but the theory sometimes
has predictions,

1100
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:25,390
which are uncertain.

1101
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,640
Here we have an uncertain
prediction from theory about

1102
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,890
whether food stamps will
affect food purchases or not.

1103
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,150
So let's test it.

1104
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,210
And the way we test
it is we actually

1105
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,175
have run food stamps cash out
experiments where we literally

1106
00:45:37,175 --> 00:45:39,300
take guys on food stamps
and give them cash instead

1107
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,330
and watch what happens to their
consumption before and after.

1108
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,350
It's a real randomized trial.

1109
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,050
We literally flip a coin.

1110
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,700
Heads, you keep
your food stamps.

1111
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,290
Tails, we replace
those food stamps

1112
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:50,610
with an equal amount of cash.

1113
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:53,010
Then we watch what happens.

1114
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:59,450
What happens is that people
spend about 15% less on food

1115
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,430
when you give them cash
instead of food stamps.

1116
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:05,090
That is food stamps is forcing
people to spend about 15%

1117
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,560
more on food than
they would like

1118
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,470
to unconstrained by the cash.

1119
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:08,970
Yeah?

1120
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,505
AUDIENCE: Yeah, this gets
you into the behavior of

1121
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:12,200
[INAUDIBLE].

1122
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,510
I remember reading an
experiment like, if you

1123
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,230
have the price of gas go down,
the actual like amount of money

1124
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,895
spent on gas is constant.

1125
00:46:19,895 --> 00:46:21,520
And this might
translate to food stamps

1126
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,000
because like food stamps
are like explicitly on food.

1127
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,375
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, you
know, that's a great question.

1128
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:29,028
And that's you're asking about
richer theory, richer theory.

1129
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:30,945
And I'm telling you that
I'm going to give you

1130
00:46:30,945 --> 00:46:31,640
the empirical evidence.

1131
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,080
So, whatever the theory
is, the empirical evidence

1132
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,840
tells you what happens.

1133
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,810
And there's different
explanations for why.

1134
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:39,590
So the empirical evidence is
that, basically, the price

1135
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:43,200
of our paternalism is 15%, OK?

1136
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,480
We are making people,
effectively, 15% worse off.

1137
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,760
We're making them spend 15%
more food than they want to.

1138
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,500
So is it worth it?

1139
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,047
Well, actually, the
evidence is starting

1140
00:46:53,047 --> 00:46:55,380
to pour in that it might not
be worth it because there's

1141
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,338
starting to be a lot of
experiments where we're

1142
00:46:57,338 --> 00:46:59,940
giving people just cash,
especially in developing

1143
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,922
countries.

1144
00:47:00,922 --> 00:47:02,380
In developing
countries, the answer

1145
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,960
seems to be just
giving people cash

1146
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,260
makes them better
off, that actually,

1147
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,860
especially in
developing countries,

1148
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,410
people use the cash
in productive ways.

1149
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:14,643
So, for example, they have a
series of evaluation programs

1150
00:47:14,643 --> 00:47:17,310
where they've given people cash,
mostly in developing countries,

1151
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:20,728
in Africa in particular,
some in the US.

1152
00:47:20,728 --> 00:47:22,770
And they find that people
spend relatively little

1153
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:26,130
of that on drugs and
alcohol, but they actually

1154
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,707
tend to spend it productively.

1155
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:29,790
And, in fact, they found,
in developing countries,

1156
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:32,070
this often provides valuable
resources for individuals

1157
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:33,250
to start businesses.

1158
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,690
So they ran experiment Uganda
where a nonprofit company

1159
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,610
randomly offered
a group of women

1160
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:43,440
$150, which is huge
relative to their income.

1161
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,660
That's 50% to 100% of annual
income in Uganda, $150.

1162
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:53,010
And what they found was, after
two months-- after 18 months,

1163
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:55,560
these women had used that
money to start businesses.

1164
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,480
And that actually
raised their earnings.

1165
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,720
That actually effectively
doubled their earnings.

1166
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,220
From that one
injection of cash, it

1167
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,790
led them to actually double
their annual earnings, OK?

1168
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,890
So that leads one to
think that maybe we

1169
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,660
should stop being paternalistic
and just give cash.

1170
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,320
Unfortunately, if you're a
reader of policy websites like

1171
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
I am, the best one
of which is vox.com--

1172
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,535
it's a great website--

1173
00:48:19,535 --> 00:48:21,660
they had an article just
the other day pointing out

1174
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,118
how they actually followed
these women up nine years later.

1175
00:48:24,118 --> 00:48:26,500
And, nine years later, the
effect had totally gone away.

1176
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,940
So the story isn't quite
necessarily positive,

1177
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,020
but it's not negative.

1178
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,700
They're not worse
off, but it looks

1179
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,200
like, at least what
in the short run

1180
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,990
made them better off, well,
that effect fades over time.

1181
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,610
But the bottom line
is, at this point,

1182
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:39,750
I think the evidence
is sort of probably

1183
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,700
in favor of being
less paternalistic

1184
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,090
and just giving
people cash, but that

1185
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,670
runs into a lot of difficulties
in terms of our concerns

1186
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,350
about how people will spend it.

1187
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,150
So let me stop there.

1188
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,580
We will come back
on Monday, and we'll

1189
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,430
talk about how we actually go
from this stuff to the demand

1190
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,000
curves we started
the class with.
