JONATHAN GRUBER: OK,
so let's continue.

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,050
So this is actually,
in some sense,

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,860
a key breaking
point in the course.

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,430
Which is, in some sense
what we've done so far

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,160
is give you a set of
tools to understand

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,378
how to think about how consumers
and producers make decisions,

8
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:30,920
and then to understand how you
compare positive and normative

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,868
implications of economics.

10
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:34,910
What we're going to do
for the rest of the class,

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,430
for the rest of the
semester, is we're

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,210
going to start to talk about how
you apply those tools to more

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,640
realistic situations.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,140
Let me answer your very first
question, what you learn today

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,240
is not on the midterm, OK?

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,320
So that's the question that's
all on your mind because it is.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,660
So the midterm tomorrow
night will cover everything

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,825
through what we covered
through last week,

19
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:57,950
but what we learn today
will not be in the midterm.

20
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,340
But don't leave because
it will be on the final

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,670
and it is interesting.

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,320
So what we're going
to do today is

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,190
talk about taking the tools we
developed so far in this class

24
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,640
and applying to more
realistic situations.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,310
And the more realist situation
we're going to start with

26
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,590
is the case of monopoly.

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,350
And we don't talk about
monopoly profit maximization.

28
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,200
Now so far on the
producer side we've

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,450
been discussing one extreme
of how the market's organized,

30
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,370
which is perfect competition.

31
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,220
And perfect competition
is a wonderful sort

32
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,680
of theoretical
benchmark but never

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,970
actually exists in reality.

34
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,680
No market is
perfectly competitive.

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,800
The other extreme is not widely
applicable but still does

36
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,110
exist in reality,
which is monopoly, OK?

37
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,570
Monopoly is a situation where a
market only has one firm in it.

38
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,300
So a market with one firm
is a monopoly market, OK?

39
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,960
So that's basically a case
where you have only one

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,570
firm providing the good, OK?

41
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,840
Now in reality,
most markets fall

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,460
between perfect competition,
which never truly exists,

43
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,720
and monopoly, which
rarely exists.

44
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,200
Most markets are in between,
we call them oligopolies.

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,830
That's markets
with several firms

46
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,750
but not perfectly competing.

47
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,035
And we'll get to that.

48
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:26,410
But that's actually one of
the harder things we'll cover,

49
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,780
so we're going to start with
this other extreme of monopoly

50
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,460
which gives us a lot
of the insights we

51
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,070
need for oligopoly but
in a much simpler case.

52
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,880
Now, the key thing with
monopoly, the key difference

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,150
from what we've done so
far is that now firms

54
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,200
are going to be price
makers, not price takers.

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,900
That's going to be the key
change from the perfectly

56
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,830
competitive situation.

57
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,660
The perfectly
competitive situation,

58
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,700
from any given
firm's perspective

59
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,280
the price is something given
them by the great market.

60
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,170
OK, we talked with
our two diagrams side

61
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,170
by side about how the
market gives the price.

62
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,810
But we sort of-- from any
given firm's perspective

63
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,190
they were price taker.

64
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,880
They couldn't affect the price.

65
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,260
Monopolists however,
when you're the only firm

66
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,330
you get to set the price.

67
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,260
So monopolists are going to be
price makers, not price takers.

68
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,980
And that's going to change the
dynamics of everything we do,

69
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,020
and that'll be our
focus today, OK?

70
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,750
So that's going to
be the big change,

71
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,520
we'll go from competitive
markets to monopoly markets.

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,410
Now, for the first 2/3
or 3/4 of the lecture

73
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,430
we're going to make
one other assumption.

74
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:43,120
We are going to assume there is
one price in this market, that

75
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,148
is no price discrimination.

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,810
This monopolist sets
the price, but he

77
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,240
sets one price for everybody.

78
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,550
So if a monopolist
is selling a good,

79
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,350
they sell that at one price
to everybody buys the good.

80
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,557
Now once again, this
is not super realistic,

81
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:04,640
monopolists often have
different prices for goods.

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,827
But it's a very important,
helpful extreme.

83
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:09,410
And you've got to remember that
we're imposing this constraint

84
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,285
because it's going to
drive the intuition I'm

85
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:12,440
going to come to next, OK?

86
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,380
So you're a firm selling
a good at one price.

87
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,019
You offer it up, anybody can
buy it at that price, OK?

88
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,300
Now, what we're going to do--

89
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,010
if you remember, a mon-- the
fundamental part of producer

90
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,910
that holds is the
goal of monopolists

91
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:35,320
is to maximize his profits, OK,
which is revenues minus costs.

92
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,330
And as we showed
before, profits are

93
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,320
maximized when marginal
revenue equals marginal cost.

94
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,710
That's the profit
maximization point.

95
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,160
Now, nothing on the cost
side is going to change.

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,200
So monopolish monopolist,
the way we get cost curves

97
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,893
doesn't change.

98
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:56,810
That's all about--
remember, because that just

99
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,670
comes the technology
production and that

100
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,512
comes from input prices.

101
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,470
So nothing on the cost
side is going to change.

102
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,300
All that hard and
somewhat boring

103
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,470
work we did deriving
cost functions and stuff,

104
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,490
that all is-- that's done.

105
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,740
The only place monopoly gets
exciting is on the margin

106
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,010
revenue side, because before we
said marginal revenue was just

107
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,500
price for a price taker.

108
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,640
But that's no longer true.

109
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,303
Marginal revenue is
no longer just price.

110
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,470
Now marginal revenue's going
to be more interesting.

111
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,020
So the monopoly
difference, if you will,

112
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,890
or the imperfect
competition difference,

113
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,032
doesn't come at all
from the cost side.

114
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:36,240
That side is done, doesn't
matter what kind of market

115
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,650
you're looking at, OK?

116
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,120
All the interesting
action here is

117
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,480
on the revenue side as we think
about monopoly and oligopoly

118
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,280
markets, OK?

119
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,910
So to think about that,
let's go to figure 11-1.

120
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,370
Think about-- let's start by
think about a competitive firm.

121
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,825
This is a diagram I
could have shown earlier.

122
00:05:56,825 --> 00:05:59,450
It just sort of is a way to
think about a competitive firm.

123
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,840
Think about a competitive
firm's profits.

124
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,260
So imagine that this firm--

125
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,340
to make life easy
let's imagine that we

126
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,080
have a firm with
marginal cost of 0, OK?

127
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,660
So you've got demand curve, and
so therefore any money you make

128
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,680
is profit.

129
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,982
And we're in the short run, OK?

130
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,440
So there's profit
in the short run,

131
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,820
even for this perfectly
competitive firm.

132
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,430
But a perfectly competitive
firm faces a horizontal demand

133
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,160
curve.

134
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,770
So if they sell
q units, OK, they

135
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,010
make profits of area
a, which is simply

136
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,700
q times P1, little q times P1.

137
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,130
If they sell q
plus 1 units, they

138
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,980
make an extra profit
rectangle of B.

139
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,860
So literally, the marginal--
the extra profit they make

140
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,840
is just the amount
P. It's 1 times P1.

141
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,190
The horizontal distance
from q to q plus 1 is 1,

142
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,390
the vertical distance is P1.

143
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,358
So the marginal profit
is just the price, OK?

144
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:05,400
Marginal revenue, I'm
sorry, it's just the price.

145
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,352
Yeah?

146
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:08,310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
competitive [INAUDIBLE]..

147
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,800
JONATHAN GRUBER: Once it's in
the short run there can be,

148
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,010
right?

149
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,600
In the short run there can be
profit in a competitive market.

150
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,868
In the long run
there's no profit, OK?

151
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,410
So basically, their
marginal revenue,

152
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,390
what they make-- that next unit
they make is the price, OK?

153
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:25,810
Now let's think about
a monopoly firm.

154
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,410
A monopoly firm does not face a
perfectly elastic demand curve

155
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,590
because a monopoly firm's demand
curve is the whole market.

156
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,970
Notice little q has become
big Q on the x-axis.

157
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,910
The monopolist no longer faces
only their perfectly elastic

158
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,230
firm demand.

159
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,710
They face a market demand, which
can be any degree of elasticity

160
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,270
but typically is
somewhat elastic.

161
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,350
It's downward sloping.

162
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,910
Now let's say
you're a monopolist

163
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,070
and you're selling big
Q units at a price P1.

164
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,530
Your profits are C plus A. Once
again, same marginal cost of 0

165
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,060
to make this easy, or C plus A.

166
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,050
Now let's say you want
to sell one more unit.

167
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,720
Well, what's different?

168
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,420
What's different is
now you're facing

169
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,770
a downward sloping demand curve.

170
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,950
So if you want to
sell one more unit

171
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,800
you have to lower the price.

172
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,390
That's the difference.

173
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,520
If you want to
sell another unit,

174
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,880
you can only do so by
lowering the price.

175
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,490
And you're a price maker, so
you have the right to do that.

176
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,990
So if you want to
sell another unit,

177
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,610
two things are going to happen.

178
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,789
A, you are going to
sell a second unit

179
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,110
and make money on that unit.

180
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,539
That's the area B.

181
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,380
But b-- I should
say one and two.

182
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,630
One, you sell the second unit.

183
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,415
That's the area B.

184
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:46,040
Two, you will lose money
all the other units

185
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,030
you sold because now you
have to lower the price.

186
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,210
Because remember, there's
only one price, OK?

187
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,920
So basically, you
used to make A plus C.

188
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,010
Now you make A plus B. You've
added B, but you've lost C.

189
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,080
So what is the marginal revenue?

190
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,390
The marginal revenue
for a monopolist

191
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:16,415
is now the area B minus the
area C. Or P2, which is area B--

192
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:24,860
1 times P2 minus
P2 minus P1 minus

193
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,140
P2 times Q0, the
original quantity.

194
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,530
OK?

195
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,420
This is the area C,
but this is the area

196
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,330
B. The original quantity
times the change in price.

197
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,670
So your marginal revenue is
not this simple just priced

198
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,253
more and more.

199
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:44,690
Now it's this more
complicated term, OK?

200
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,710
More generally, marginal
revenue can be defined

201
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,810
as-- the marginal
revenue is defined as--

202
00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:04,630
marginal revenue is defined as
P plus delta P delta Q times Q.

203
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,200
That's marginal revenue.

204
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
The first term is
positive, that's

205
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,820
the money you make
on the next unit.

206
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,260
The second term is negative
because, by definition,

207
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,940
the demand curve's
downward sloping.

208
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,920
There's no given goods
anymore in this class.

209
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,040
Demand may be on a test
but not in reality.

210
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,740
The demand curve's
downward sloping, OK?

211
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,010
So this term is negative.

212
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,770
Now once again,
I'm writing delta

213
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,980
but really it's derivative.

214
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,855
So this is all increment--
this is all-- this

215
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,030
is sort of epsilon changes.

216
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,280
This is Q0, OK?

217
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,870
This is sort of epsilon changes.

218
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,390
But the bottom line is, for
an epsilon change in price

219
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,660
you get--

220
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,120
for an epsilon
change in quantity

221
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,820
you get the price
on the unit you

222
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,550
sell minus the money you lost.

223
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,350
And then you too can
no longer sell, OK?

224
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,960
This is the key intuition
of monopoly math.

225
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,737
The k-- yeah?

226
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:00,404
AUDIENCE: What's that
equation equal to?

227
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:02,720
That [INAUDIBLE]

228
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,370
JONATHAN GRUBER: This is
your marginal revenue.

229
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,820
I just did it graphically.

230
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,030
That's your marginal revenue.

231
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,760
You just see that
from the graph, OK,

232
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,183
and I just rewrote it here, OK?

233
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:15,600
So basica-- or for those of
you into calculus, if you just

234
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,280
differentiate, just-- if those
of you who have your calculus,

235
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,950
you could just write, you
know, dR dQ, d revenue dQ, OK,

236
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,860
what do you get?

237
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,620
You get P plus dP dQ
times Q. That's just

238
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,350
the derivative of revenue
with respect to quantity, OK?

239
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,660
So let's think
intuitively about what's

240
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,750
going on here because this
is very, very important.

241
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,110
What's going on here
is to sell another unit

242
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,360
you have to lower your price.

243
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,670
You're working your way
down your demand curve.

244
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,920
And therefore, it
offsets the benefit

245
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,120
you get from selling
another unit, OK?

246
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,780
I like to call this
the poisoning effect.

247
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,780
I mean, it's not
original to me but it's

248
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,930
a term that I've heard use that
I like, the poisoning effect.

249
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,850
The idea is that to
sell another unit,

250
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,700
I have to poison
myself a little bit

251
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,632
by lowering the price on all
the previous units I sold.

252
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:23,840
If I want to go out in the
market and force consumers

253
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,970
to buy one more unit, I've
got to lower the price

254
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,050
on all the units which
offsets money I used to make.

255
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,540
So that's why we call it a
sort of poisoning effect.

256
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,590
Now, why doesn't a competitive
firm face this issue?

257
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,293
Why are we just
bringing this up now?

258
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:41,293
Why does a monopoly firm
face a poisoning effect

259
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,585
and a competitive firm doesn't?

260
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:44,626
Or alternatively, another
way to ask the question

261
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:46,500
is, in what situation
would a monopoly firm

262
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,930
not face a poisoning effect?

263
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,531
Yeah?

264
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:53,140
AUDIENCE: Actually,
in a [INAUDIBLE]

265
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:59,622
in a competitive
firm [INAUDIBLE]

266
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:00,580
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

267
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,205
They're not-- that's
[INAUDIBLE] right.

268
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:03,930
The competitive firm's
the price taker.

269
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,410
But in particular, even
though the price taker,

270
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,240
why when they sell more quantity
is there no poisoning effect?

271
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,810
Yeah?

272
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,080
AUDIENCE: Demand is
perfectly inelastic?

273
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,140
JONATHAN GRUBER: Demand
it's is perfectly elastic.

274
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,557
The firm faced a
perfectly elast--

275
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:20,060
so likewise, a monopolist facing
a perfectly elastic demand

276
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,340
would also have no
poisoning effect.

277
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,240
Think of it this
way, what is dP dQ

278
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,790
with perfectly elastic demand?

279
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,730
Zero.

280
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,530
The price doesn't
change, you sell more.

281
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,140
So the reason the
perfectly competitive firm

282
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,270
face no poisoning effect
is because it's facing a--

283
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,830
it doesn't, the
price doesn't have

284
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,502
to change to sell
more units, OK?

285
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:41,210
But a monopolist faces
a poisoning effect

286
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,225
because it's got a downward
sloping demand curve.

287
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,220
OK?

288
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,910
So we can actually see this--

289
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,950
so what we want to
do in figure 11-3

290
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,430
is we graph the monopolist's
marginal revenue curve.

291
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,400
So let's actually work
out the math here.

292
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,167
Let's imagine there's
a demand curve.

293
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:03,000
Let's imagine that I've
got a demand curve--

294
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,510
and I'm just making this
up-- demands of the form A

295
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,150
equals 24 minus p, OK?

296
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,530
Let's just say that's
the demand curve, OK?

297
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:17,270
Now the first step is to
flip the way we express this

298
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,060
and write this-- write price
as a function of quantity

299
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,200
because now the monopolist
is choosing his price.

300
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,060
So we can write that p
equals 24 minus Q, OK?

301
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,540
Just inverting it, writing
price as a function of quantity.

302
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,950
So in this case revenues,
which are equal to p times Q,

303
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,640
are equal to 24Q
minus Q squared.

304
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,540
I just multiply through by Q.

305
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,230
So marginal revenues
differentiating

306
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:50,398
are just 24 minus 2Q, OK?

307
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,690
So once again, this is a new
sort of mathematical trick

308
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,690
you'll have to get used to.

309
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,500
Flip the demand curve,
so you express price

310
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,870
as a function of quantity.

311
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,340
Multiply through by Q
and then differentiate,

312
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,810
and you get that marginal
revenue is 24 minus 2Q.

313
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,030
So you can see that
in figure 11-3,

314
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:15,050
the marginal revenue curve is
the demand curve shifted in,

315
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,520
OK?

316
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,260
Now in fact, this
nice relationship

317
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,220
will not always hold.

318
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,690
This sort of picture
of a marginal revenue

319
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,810
curve being the demand
curve shift [INAUDIBLE]

320
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,410
will not always hold.

321
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,290
It only holds for
certain functional forms.

322
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,870
Mostly we'll use functional
forms for where it holds.

323
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,330
The main lesson is the
marginal revenue curve

324
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,480
has to be at or below
the demand curve.

325
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,100
That's the proof, OK?

326
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,130
Whether it has this nice sort
of shifted in relationship,

327
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,555
that depends very much
on functional form.

328
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:44,930
But what is absolutely true
is the marginal revenue curve

329
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,530
is always everywhere at
or below the demand curve.

330
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,280
Why?

331
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,260
Because the demand curve--

332
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,210
because by selling
a next unit you're

333
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,575
going to make less through
this poisoning effect.

334
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:57,200
So the marginal
revenue curve is always

335
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,590
below the demand
curve, all right?

336
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,720
Questions about that?

337
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,470
OK, so now let's go on and
let's talk about the critical

338
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,600
relationship which I just
developed-- intuitive,

339
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,220
let's do it mathematically--

340
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,630
between marginal revenue and
the elasticity of demand.

341
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,410
OK, so take this--

342
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:29,740
we've got our marginal
revenue expression,

343
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:40,180
marginal revenue equals p plus
delta p delta Q times Q, OK?

344
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,540
Now take that expression and
multiply and divide by p.

345
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,290
So I'm just going to
take this expression,

346
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,770
I'm going to multiply
and divide by p, OK?

347
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,240
Then I'm going to
get p plus delta

348
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:02,360
p over p delta Q over
Q times Q over p--

349
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:06,286
oh, p plus p.

350
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:07,619
I'm sorry, no, I did this wrong.

351
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,054
My bad, don't write that down.

352
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:11,266
I've got to look
more at my notes.

353
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:12,349
I'm going to write it as--

354
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,932
I'm going to multiply
and divide by p.

355
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:21,890
p plus p times, yeah, delta
p delta Q times Q over p.

356
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,569
I skipped a step.

357
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,310
So I just multiplied
and divided by p,

358
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,869
multiplied and divided by p.

359
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:31,810
p plus p times delta Q, delta
p over delta Q times Q over p,

360
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,570
OK?

361
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,020
Now if you look at this
expression, delta p over delta

362
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,080
Q times Q over p,
that is the inverse

363
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,330
of the elasticity of demand.

364
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:48,160
So you can rewrite this
as p plus p times 1

365
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,510
over the elasticity of demand.

366
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,270
Or rewriting one more
time, that marginal revenue

367
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,630
equals p times 1 plus 1 over
the elasticity of demand.

368
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,110
Marginal revenue
equals p times 1 plus 1

369
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,870
over the elasticity of demand.

370
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,730
So think about
this for a second.

371
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,360
This gets the intuition
we just talked about.

372
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,890
If e is-- if the elasticity
is negative infinite--

373
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,510
is negative infinity--

374
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,587
OK I had it wrong with 0.

375
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:19,170
It's the elasticity of demand
is negative infinity then you've

376
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,213
a competitive market.

377
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:22,380
Perfectly competitive market
is elasticity of demand

378
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,280
negative infinity so you get
a competitive market, OK?

379
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,380
As the elasticity of demand--

380
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:39,460
but if the elasticity of demand
is 0, if the elasticity of--

381
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,285
if the elasticity of demand goes
like-- the elasticity of demand

382
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:43,110
is negative 1.

383
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,060
Let's do that case.

384
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,510
So negative infinity is
perfectly competitive, OK?

385
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,070
What about negative 1?

386
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,020
What's special about
the elasticity of demand

387
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,630
of negative 1 in this case?

388
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,940
What's the marginal revenue?

389
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,080
0.

390
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,020
That's the case going
back to figure 11-2 where

391
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,263
B and C exactly cancel out.

392
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:04,680
So you probably
thought about this

393
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,580
when you looked at this graph.

394
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,330
You probably quickly
asked yourself, well,

395
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,270
should the monopolist
try to sell more or not?

396
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,103
Well the answer is, the
elasticity of demand

397
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:13,690
is minus 1, they're indifferent.

398
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,490
So this is sort of
the important insight.

399
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,665
With an elastic
demand of minus 1,

400
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:20,918
me monopolist is indifferent
about selling another unit

401
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:22,960
because what they gain
from selling the unit they

402
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,765
lose on the previous units.

403
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,890
If the elasticity of demand
is greater than minus 1

404
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,410
absolute value, then
they're going to lose money

405
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,450
by selling additional units.

406
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,030
If the elasticity of
demand is less than 1,

407
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,398
then they're going to make money
by selling additional units.

408
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:41,690
But let's-- I'm skipping ahead.

409
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,080
Let's go on and talk about
profit maximization, OK?

410
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,690
So let's go on and take the
next step which is the monopoly

411
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,580
profit maximization.

412
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,100
Imagine a monopolist's
cost function curve is

413
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,485
of the form 12 plus q squared.

414
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,360
Let's take the same
monopolist and write down

415
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,340
cost function of 12
plus q squared, OK?

416
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,800
So with this cost function,
marginal cost equals 2q.

417
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,070
That's marginal cost with
this cost function, OK?

418
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,980
So what's the profit
maximization rule?

419
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,265
It's that marginal revenue
equals marginal cost.

420
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:23,380
Well marginal revenue, we wrote
down here, is 24 minus 2Q,

421
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,225
so it's where 24 minus
2Q equals marginal--

422
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:31,077
I should-- equals marginal cost.

423
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:32,660
Now with monopolists
here's the trick,

424
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,420
little q and big Q are the same.

425
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,130
So I wrote a little
q here, but if you're

426
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,200
the only firm in the
market little q and big Q

427
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,265
are the same, right?

428
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:41,050
There's only one
firm in the market.

429
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,910
So 24 minus 2Q equals--

430
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,450
it's a big Q now-- equals 2Q.

431
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,370
So the optimization point
is where 24 equals 4Q or Q

432
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,390
star equals six.

433
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,320
That's the optimal-- that's
the profit maximizing

434
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,610
sale on quantity for
the monopolist is

435
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,310
where 24 minus 2Q, where
marginal revenue equals

436
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:05,950
marginal cost.

437
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,210
We derive marginal revenue, OK?

438
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,390
Marginal cost we know how to
derive from our cost function.

439
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,830
We set them equal and we get
the optimizing quantity, OK?

440
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,695
And you can see
this in figure 11-4.

441
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,790
Figure 11-4 shows
what's going on here.

442
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,320
So I've driven all the va--

443
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,500
I've drawn all the various cost
curves for this cost function,

444
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,895
OK?

445
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,270
I've driven all
the various costs

446
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,760
first for this cost function.

447
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,190
You can see the
marginal cost curve

448
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,770
and then you can see it
intersects the marginal revenue

449
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,990
curve at a quantity of 6.

450
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,340
Intersects the marginal revenue
curve at a quantity of 6, OK?

451
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,066
What is the price?

452
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,320
Someone raise their hand
and tell me, tell me why.

453
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,470
The quantity 6, what's--

454
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,250
what price has the
monopolist set?

455
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:01,833
Yeah?

456
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:02,437
AUDIENCE: 18.

457
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:03,270
JONATHAN GRUBER: 18.

458
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,800
Why-- you're supposed
to get that wrong.

459
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,810
You didn't-- you didn't, you
didn't follow my instructions,

460
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,850
you didn't get it wrong.

461
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,270
You got it right,
I'm just joking.

462
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,220
How did you know it
was 18 and not 12?

463
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,470
Usually people guess 12
because that's the point where

464
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,345
the curves intersect.

465
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:15,030
Why is it 18?

466
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,210
AUDIENCE: You can go
up to the demand curve

467
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,370
because that's what
people are willin--

468
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,245
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because
even the monopolist,

469
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:22,590
as powerful as he is,
has to respect demand.

470
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,600
So the monopolist if they're
going to sell 6 units,

471
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,390
they have to choose a
price such that people

472
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,020
want to buy 6 units.

473
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,667
So your intuition,
which is my fault--

474
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,750
I've always said, look
where the curves intersect,

475
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,110
do a quantity and a price--

476
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,068
your quick intuition,
which was to look and say

477
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:40,930
the price was 12, which was the
wrong answer I usually get, OK,

478
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,290
is wrong because you
need to actually respect

479
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,000
the demand curve.

480
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,580
So a monopolist solves
for the optimal quantity,

481
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,410
but then to get
the optimal price

482
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,400
he has to plug this back
into the demand curve.

483
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,650
Well, what's demand?

484
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,860
Demand is 24 minus p.

485
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,500
So-- I'm sorry, it's p equals
24 minus Q, that's our demand.

486
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:08,480
So if Q star is 6, then
price is 24 minus 6, or 18.

487
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,580
P star is 18, and that is
what you will get wrong

488
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,493
when you do this.

489
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,910
If you're going to get anything
wrong in monopoly problems

490
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,952
this is what you're going
to get wrong, OK, which

491
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:20,750
is remembering you can't just--

492
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,630
at the end you have to
do an extra step here.

493
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,930
To get the price you have
to solve for quantity,

494
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,550
but then respect the demand
curve to get the price.

495
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,820
There's a question somewhere.

496
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,415
OK, yeah, question?

497
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:38,922
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] of the
intersection of the [INAUDIBLE]

498
00:23:38,922 --> 00:23:40,380
JONATHAN GRUBER:
It's pretty much--

499
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,930
yeah, it's pretty
much meaningless.

500
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,400
So that intersection used to
pin down the quantity, but price

501
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,960
has to come from
the demand curve

502
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,460
because you have to respect--

503
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,877
you can't sell
something consumers

504
00:23:50,877 --> 00:23:52,488
don't want to buy, OK?

505
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:54,280
So you've got to respect
that demand curve.

506
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,860
And in fact, you
can show yourself--

507
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:08,350
so basically-- OK,
so basically that's

508
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:13,790
the profit maximization except
this stupid goddamn shutdown

509
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,155
rule still holds.

510
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:17,655
In the short run we still have
to respect to shut down rule,

511
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:20,270
so you still have
to check, is price

512
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,320
less than average variable cost?

513
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,910
Now once again, in this
function OK, in this f--

514
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,420
you have to check
with the price.

515
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,780
So even if profits
are negative you're

516
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,850
still going to have to
check if price is greater

517
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,017
than average variable costs.

518
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:37,558
Now here at 6 units, the
average variable cost is 6.

519
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:39,600
You see-- we could see--
you see the dashed line.

520
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,912
If we sell 6 units, the
average variable cost is 6.

521
00:24:41,912 --> 00:24:44,370
So clearly price is greater
than the average variable cost.

522
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,200
You wouldn't shut down, you're
making positive profits,

523
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,990
in fact.

524
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,310
You're making profits of 60,
OK, so you wouldn't shut down.

525
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,920
But you always do have to
check the shut down rule, OK?

526
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,370
So that's how you do a
monopoly problem, OK?

527
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,920
Just to go back, how you
do a monopoly problem,

528
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,260
you'll be given
a cost function--

529
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,270
you know what to do
those in your sleep--

530
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,960
and a demand function.

531
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,060
The demand function gets
turned into a marginal revenue

532
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,790
function simply through
these couple of steps.

533
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,190
So the demand function gives
you a marginal revenue function.

534
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,560
If you have marginal revenue
and you have marginal cost,

535
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,657
then you know how to solve
for optimal quantity.

536
00:25:21,657 --> 00:25:24,240
If you have optimal quantity and
you respect the demand curve,

537
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,650
you know how to solve for price.

538
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:32,200
Once you have a price, OK,
and an average cost curve

539
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,230
you can both check the shutdown
rule and compute profits.

540
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:39,310
Profits are simply the price
you get minus average costs.

541
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,350
So we can compute the profit
and check the shutdown rule, OK?

542
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,560
So the only thing we
did here that's new

543
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,080
is this sort of interesting
quirk that we have,

544
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,790
this new marginal
revenue function.

545
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,123
Otherwise, it's the same sort
of analysis we did before.

546
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,040
So this should be doable
with some practice.

547
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,520
Now, the key-- a key concept
here that we need to think

548
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,020
about, that comes to question,
you might have asked yourself

549
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,160
at some point--

550
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,650
you might have said,
well, if monopolists

551
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,140
are the only firm in the
market, why don't they

552
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,520
just charge whatever they want?

553
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,692
Why do they have to--

554
00:26:15,692 --> 00:26:18,150
why are they sort of constrained
by the sort of mathematics

555
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,650
we've done before?

556
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,370
And to answer this, let's turn
to the concept of market power.

557
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,280
The market power
of monopolists we

558
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,270
will define as their ability
to charge price greater

559
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,760
than marginal cost.

560
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,060
Your ability to charge price
greater than margin cost

561
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,180
is your market power.

562
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,490
In other words, competitive
firms have no market power.

563
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,907
They have to charge
a price that's

564
00:26:41,907 --> 00:26:43,260
the same as their marginal cost.

565
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,890
And that's why
they make no money.

566
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,180
Monopolists have
market power, OK?

567
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,310
So now let's return
to the condition

568
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,110
for profit maximization.

569
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,180
We said that
marginal revenue can

570
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,200
be rewritten as
price times 1 plus 1

571
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,910
over the elasticity
of demand, right?

572
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,145
That equals marginal cost.

573
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:14,330
So we can rewrite this as
marginal cost over price

574
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:20,110
equals 1 plus 1 over the
elasticity of demand.

575
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,680
And this is the monopolist's
market power condition.

576
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,400
So if we define the market--

577
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,775
so we can define something
we call a markup.

578
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,500
Casually we can call it
profits, but technically it's

579
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,250
the markup, OK, as
the percentage markup

580
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,640
a monopolist can
make as p minus MC

581
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,810
over p, how much of the price
is actually a markup over cost?

582
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,640
It's sort of an
intuitive concept.

583
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,440
So basically, how
much of the money

584
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,110
you get for the unit is a markup
as a share of the money you

585
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,020
get?

586
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,480
Then that is simply--
that is equal to minus 1

587
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,590
over the elasticity of demand.

588
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,810
So the monopolist markup is
equal to 1 over-- minus 1

589
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,490
over the elasticity of demand.

590
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,720
So if the elasticity of
demand is negative infinity,

591
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,440
that is a perfectly
competitive market.

592
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,510
Then the markup is what?

593
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,140
0, just like a competitive firm.

594
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,630
Competitive firms have
to charge marginal cost.

595
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,630
But as demand gets
more inelastic

596
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,960
the monopolist gains
power to mark up the price

597
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,620
and make money.

598
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,790
And this answers our
question of why monopolists

599
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,320
aren't infinitely powerful.

600
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,660
What is the limiting
factor of monopolists?

601
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,400
It's not other firms
producing their good.

602
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,150
What's the limiting
factor on monopolists?

603
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,770
Yeah?

604
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,187
AUDIENCE: How much more will
they compete with [INAUDIBLE]

605
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,610
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
it's other products.

606
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,515
So think about a
monopolist in insulin.

607
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:57,890
They can charge
whatever the hell

608
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,550
they want, right, because
basically there's nothing else

609
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,637
to buy.

610
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:04,220
Well, maybe multiple
insulin products,

611
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,460
but imagine one
insulin product, OK?

612
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,170
So nothing constrains
the monopolist.

613
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,878
He should charge an
infinite price up to,

614
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:13,820
like, what Congress
will put up with, OK?

615
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,040
But if you think about
a monopolist in a good

616
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,820
where there's a substitute-- so
if I'm the monopolist in gum,

617
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,740
if I'm a gum-opolist,
OK, then I'm

618
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,330
constrained by how
much people want

619
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,140
to-- eventually people just
substitute the candy, OK?

620
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,120
Anything-- so I'm
constrained not

621
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,910
by competitors in my
market, but by the fact

622
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,250
that consumers can
substitute to other goods.

623
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,860
So what's the limit
on monopolists?

624
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,830
Consumers, we're the
limit on monopolists.

625
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,470
Our willingness to put up
with that good relative

626
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,210
to other goods, i.e.

627
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,300
Our elasticity of
demand, is the only thing

628
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,300
limiting monopolists, OK?

629
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,952
So basically, there is market
discipline to monopolists.

630
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:58,910
Even though they're the
only provider of a good

631
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,040
they're still subject
to market discipline.

632
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,010
It's just the discipline
doesn't come from other firms,

633
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,360
it comes from consumers, OK?

634
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,150
So a great example of
this is let's look,

635
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,350
if you go on-- at least as of
last year, if you go on Amazon

636
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:19,250
and look at the
prices of two goods

637
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,230
that you've probably
had to consume

638
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,580
in high school, Huckleberry
Finn and Great Gatsby, two books

639
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,600
that many of you had to
consume in high school.

640
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,975
You had to read
Huckleberry Finn,

641
00:30:28,975 --> 00:30:30,890
you had to read Great Gatsby.

642
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,600
They're both
comparable lengths--

643
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,920
Great Gatsby is a
little shorter I think,

644
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,120
but they're both
comparable lengths.

645
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,920
The production cost--
the marginal cost

646
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,740
to produce them is probably
pretty comparable, OK?

647
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,750
But if you go on
Amazon, Huck Finn

648
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,735
costs $4 and the Great
Gatsby costs $16.

649
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,400
Now why is this?

650
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,720
Why is this, anyone know?

651
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,110
Why does Great Gatsby
cost four times as much?

652
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it
was banned [INAUDIBLE]

653
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,140
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's interesting.

654
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,380
That's not enough to explain.

655
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,360
It's not banned
in enough places,

656
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,860
fortunately, to explain that.

657
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,540
What else is going
on, anyone know?

658
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,648
Yeah, in the red shirt, yeah?

659
00:31:05,648 --> 00:31:07,690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
competitive-- it has, like,

660
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,148
has no copyright infringement.

661
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:10,190
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

662
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,370
The Great Gatsby still
has copyright protection.

663
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,940
That is, only people who get
permission from the great--

664
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,370
from William Scott
Fitzgerald's descendants--

665
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:26,290
F. Scott Fitzgerald, I'm sorry,
descendents get to produce it.

666
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:31,260
They have a monopoly on the
good that is The Great Gatsby.

667
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:36,150
Huck Finn, it turns out that 75
years after an author's death

668
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,940
copyright protection expires.

669
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,640
F. Scott Fitzgerald hasn't
been dead for 75 years,

670
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,250
Mark Twain has.

671
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,300
So Huck Finn can now
be produced by anyone.

672
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,592
You can go out tomorrow and
produce a copy of Huck Finn

673
00:31:47,592 --> 00:31:49,190
and sell it.

674
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,190
So we think probably Huck
Finn should be produced

675
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,500
in a pretty competitive market.

676
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,450
That is, basically
the $4 you pay

677
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,992
for Huck Finn should be roughly
the cost of producing a book.

678
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:00,742
OK, now no market's
perfectly competitive,

679
00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:02,300
a little markup but not much.

680
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,070
Whereas The Great Gatsby, it's
not limited by competition.

681
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,820
But it is limited by
the fact that if they

682
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,920
try to charge $500
for Great Gatsby

683
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,830
teachers would assign
something else, OK?

684
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,790
There's still a limit.

685
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,100
It's only $16, that's
not a whole lot for one

686
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,770
of the great works
of literature, OK?

687
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,670
It's still only $16.

688
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,200
So why is it only $16?

689
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,783
Because it's limited
by the fact there

690
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:25,490
are other great works of
literature people can turn to.

691
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,660
So Huck Finn is limited
by the competition

692
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,030
within the market for the--

693
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,170
across producers producing
some homogeneous good.

694
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,260
It's probably a pretty close to
the competitive market, right?

695
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,910
It's pretty easy to just set up
a shop and produce Huck Finn,

696
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,432
whereas The Great Gatsby
has this extra effect which

697
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:40,890
is copyright
protected, so its only

698
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,830
limited by the
elasticity of demand.

699
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,742
Yeah?

700
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:47,080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] be
like, [INAUDIBLE] like,

701
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,580
the effect of, like, when you
increase price again, and even

702
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,910
more with piracy, in a sense?

703
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,510
Like, if, like, when you have,
like, a really, like, expensive

704
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,820
good it leaves, like,
more incentive to steal?

705
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,640
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's a great point.

706
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,620
So the elasticity
of demand, I should

707
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,360
say the elasticity of
demand for that good,

708
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,860
where one of the substitutes
could be an illegal substitute.

709
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,280
That's a good point.

710
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,960
OK, so let's go on and
talk about the next topic

711
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,803
I want to cover today, which
is how do we-- because now we

712
00:33:10,803 --> 00:33:12,720
have a new set of tools
we've developed that's

713
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,600
really cool which lets
us ask the question,

714
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,380
not just what do monopolies do,
but how do we feel about it?

715
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,350
That is, we can now turn to
talking about the welfare

716
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,860
effects of monopoly.

717
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,570
What are the welfare
effects of monopoly?

718
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,260
How do we feel about monopoly?

719
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,760
Well, let's start with
the standard case,

720
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
that is the case we've
covered so far as opposed

721
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,000
to a case I'll cover
in a minute, OK?

722
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,230
And let's look at
figure 11-5, which

723
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,450
is the example we just solved
for, the example where demand

724
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:53,420
equals 24 minus Q and
cost is 12 plus Q squared.

725
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,980
So here we sh--

726
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,210
once again what do we do?

727
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,980
We set marginal cost
equal to marginal revenue.

728
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,070
So they sell 6 units.

729
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,620
We then say, what price
permits them to sell 6 units?

730
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,360
The price of 18.

731
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,060
So the equilibrium
is at a price of--

732
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,500
is that e little m,
little m for monopoly, OK?

733
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,350
They sell 6 units
at a price of 18.

734
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:20,620
Well at that equilibrium,
what's consumer surplus?

735
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:25,300
It's A, the area under the
demand curve, above the price.

736
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,400
So consumer surplus is area
A. What's producer surplus?

737
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,949
It's B plus D, the area below
the price above the supply

738
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,870
curve, but only for the
units that are sold.

739
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:46,929
So the consumer gets A, the
producer gets B plus D, OK?

740
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:51,940
But C plus E is
not our units that

741
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,179
are not sold for which
the marginal-- for which

742
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:59,040
the willingness to pay is above
the willingness to supply.

743
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,122
And what do we call those units?

744
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:03,205
Units that are not sold--
someone raise their hand

745
00:35:03,205 --> 00:35:03,880
and tell me--

746
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,213
units that are not sold for
which the willingness to pay

747
00:35:06,213 --> 00:35:08,220
is above the
willingness to supply?

748
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,050
Yeah?

749
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:09,390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

750
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,307
JONATHAN GRUBER: Loss.

751
00:35:10,307 --> 00:35:12,670
Those are units,
that's an inefficiency.

752
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:17,560
Those units that are not sold
that efficiently should be.

753
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,180
That is, we've broken--

754
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,720
this our first example ever.

755
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,620
This is a super exciting
moment of breaking

756
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,928
the first fundamental
theorem of welfare economics.

757
00:35:25,928 --> 00:35:27,970
The first fundamental
theory of welfare economics

758
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:32,800
was that the equilibrium,
the competitive equilibrium

759
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,150
maximizes welfare.

760
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,980
Well, that's no longer true.

761
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,410
Here we have an equilibrium
that comes out of competition.

762
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,830
It's what the market
delivers, but it

763
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,487
doesn't maximize welfare.

764
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:47,070
There's a dead weight
loss, and that's

765
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,100
because the market's
imperfectly competitive.

766
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,060
This is our first
ever example of what

767
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,980
we call a market failure.

768
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:00,200
And that's what,
from my perspective,

769
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,735
makes economics fun.

770
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:03,110
If there were no
market failures,

771
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,690
if all markets functioned the
way we said they function, then

772
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,065
basically we could have been
largely done with the course

773
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,613
by now.

774
00:36:09,613 --> 00:36:11,030
What makes this
all interesting is

775
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,822
markets don't function
the way we said they

776
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:14,600
function in that extreme case.

777
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,840
And therefore, a
market failure is

778
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,070
defined as a case where the
market equilibrium does not

779
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,510
maximize social welfare.

780
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,780
So whenever the
market equilibrium

781
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,300
does not maximize
social welfare,

782
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,960
you've got a market failure.

783
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,788
In the perfectly
competitive case

784
00:36:33,788 --> 00:36:36,080
we didn't have a failure
because the market equilibrium

785
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,480
maximized welfare.

786
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,130
That's not true here.

787
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,370
Now the market equilibrium
does not maximize welfare.

788
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,680
Therefore, it's
a market failure.

789
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,480
Hint, what's exciting
about that to me

790
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,235
is that means there might be a
potential role for policy, OK?

791
00:36:49,235 --> 00:36:50,860
So far in this course,
the government's

792
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,740
just been a bad guy.

793
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,990
Its done nothing but set
mean minimum wages and things

794
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,020
like that, and terrible
price ceilings.

795
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,520
But in fact, as
we'll see next time,

796
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,687
this starts to introduce
the role for the government

797
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,180
as a good guy, OK?

798
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,500
Now, what makes-- to
drive this situation home,

799
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,730
make this more interesting,
let's contrast that to the more

800
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,180
realistic case of
price discrimination,

801
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,900
or potentially more realistic
case of price discrimination.

802
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,560
Now what happens if we
don't force the monopolist

803
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,780
to only charge one price?

804
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,530
What if we allow the monopolist
to charge different prices

805
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,880
to different consumers?

806
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,440
Here's a cool
conclusion actually,

807
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,620
kind of crazy conclusion.

808
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,468
If monopolists can perfectly
price discriminate,

809
00:37:36,468 --> 00:37:38,260
that is that they can
sell a separate price

810
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,710
for every consumer, then
monopoly is welfare maximizing.

811
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,270
If monopolists can set a perfect
price for every consumer,

812
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,580
then monopoly does
maximize social welfare.

813
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,680
To see that, simply
look at figure 11-6.

814
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,980
Now let's take a perfectly
price discriminating monopolist.

815
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,190
Let's think about what--
this prices they've set.

816
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,115
Well, essentially what they're
going to do is set price where?

817
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:09,490
A price discriminating
monopolist

818
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,000
is going to set the price
for each unit to what?

819
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,845
Yeah?

820
00:38:13,845 --> 00:38:14,720
AUDIENCE: The demand.

821
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,580
JONATHAN GRUBER: The demand,
the willingness to pay.

822
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,320
If you're perfectly
price discriminating,

823
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,840
you will screw
consumers to the max.

824
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,010
And how do you do that?

825
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,870
By delivering them no surplus.

826
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,040
By taking all the
surplus for yourself.

827
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,450
So for the first
unit, you charge 5.

828
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,010
For the second
unit, you charge 4.

829
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,240
And for the sixth
unit you charge 18.

830
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,660
Now, the [INAUDIBLE]---- now the
previous monopolist stopped

831
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,620
at 6.

832
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,000
Why do he stop at 6?

833
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,240
Because the sale of the seventh
unit would have lost him money.

834
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,670
He would've had to lower the
price on all previous units.

835
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,170
But the price
[INAUDIBLE] monopolist

836
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,060
has no poisoning
effect because he

837
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,880
doesn't have to lower the
price on the previous units.

838
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,650
He can say for
that seventh unit,

839
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:59,325
I'm going to sell
that one at 17.

840
00:38:59,325 --> 00:39:00,700
I'm going to make
17, and I'm not

841
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,242
going to lose any
money because I can

842
00:39:02,242 --> 00:39:04,410
keep the other prices the same.

843
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,580
So with a perfectly price
discriminating monopolist,

844
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,000
you get rid of the
poisoning effect.

845
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,200
They can just march their
way down the demand curve,

846
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,110
charging every consumer exactly
their willingness to pay.

847
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,390
Therefore, they will
continue to produce

848
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,400
until the competitive
equilibrium.

849
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,650
They will continue to produce
until willingness to pay

850
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,150
equals willingness to supply.

851
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,500
But they will capture
all the surplus.

852
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,830
So the new equilibrium
will be EC,

853
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,070
the competitive equilibrium,
but the entire surplus

854
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,870
goes to the monopolist.

855
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,940
So the fascinating
case, there's--

856
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,910
we maximize social welfare,
but only because we

857
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,070
define social welfare
in this particular way,

858
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,700
which is the simple sum of
consumer producer surplus.

859
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,920
Here, producers get
all the surplus,

860
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,790
therefore welfare is maximized.

861
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,580
So a perfectly price
discriminating monopolist,

862
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:55,650
OK, gets maximized
social welfare, OK?

863
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,530
Now, there's two interesting
points to come out of this.

864
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,980
Point one is this is a
cool way to understand

865
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,557
why there's a dead
weight loss for monopoly.

866
00:40:05,557 --> 00:40:07,390
It's cool to understand
because you can see-

867
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,015
you can focus on that point
E sub M and think about why

868
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:12,640
the perfectly price [INAUDIBLE]
monopolist gets to sell another

869
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,650
unit and the regular
monopolist doesn't.

870
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,258
Because the regular monopolist
has the poising effect

871
00:40:17,258 --> 00:40:19,300
and the perfectly price
discriminating monopolist

872
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:19,972
does not.

873
00:40:19,972 --> 00:40:21,430
So it's a good way
to sort of think

874
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,210
about that intuition of
the poisoning effect.

875
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,430
That's lesson one.

876
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,748
Lesson two is, gee, we may
want to talk about definition

877
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:32,040
of welfare that's not just
the sum of consumer producer

878
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,920
surplus.

879
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,720
A model of welfare that delivers
the fact that a producer that

880
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,360
can screw every single consumer
out of any of their surplus

881
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,430
is the best possible
outcome might not

882
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,460
be a model we're
so happy with, OK?

883
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,140
But that we can come back to.

884
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,350
But for now it's a nice extreme.

885
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,060
And in fact, in reality
no firm is perfectly

886
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,320
price discriminating, OK?

887
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,022
Amazon tried to be.

888
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:56,730
There was a controversy
a number of years

889
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,810
ago where Amazon would set
your price according to your--

890
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,930
what's the little, the string
of numbers address, IP address.

891
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,590
They literally would set
prices by IP address.

892
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,330
They'd literally
say, well you know,

893
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,060
you're coming from an IP address
that's, for example, you're

894
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,192
in a high-high income area.

895
00:41:13,192 --> 00:41:14,400
I'm going to charge you more.

896
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,720
You're in a
university, therefore

897
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,053
you need this book for a course.

898
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:19,620
Therefore, I'm going to
charge you more, et cetera.

899
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,890
That, they got busted and
that was found illegal.

900
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,650
But just because you can't
perfectly price discriminate

901
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:30,000
doesn't mean we don't have lots
of examples of partial price

902
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,700
discrimination.

903
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,325
So what are examples in the real
world of price discrimination?

904
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,680
What do firms do?

905
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,240
And what's the general-- let
me ask, tell me what firms do.

906
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,240
And also I wonder, what's
the general principle?

907
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,273
What's the basic
idea that firms--

908
00:41:41,273 --> 00:41:42,690
if you want to
price discriminate,

909
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,567
what do you want to figure out?

910
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:45,900
What is your goal to figure out?

911
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,650
Yeah.

912
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,880
AUDIENCE: Isn't
[INAUDIBLE] make airplanes?

913
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,755
JONATHAN GRUBER:
[INAUDIBLE] the what?

914
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:50,190
AUDIENCE: Airplanes.

915
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:50,640
JONATHAN GRUBER: Airplanes.

916
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,303
So explain.

917
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:52,720
AUDIENCE: Because
if know somebody

918
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,510
is buying a ticket, like,
two days before a flight,

919
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,386
it's probably for
a business trip

920
00:41:55,386 --> 00:41:57,130
so they can pay
a lot more money.

921
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,630
JONATHAN GRUBER: And why are
they willing to pay more money?

922
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,670
AUDIENCE: Um, because
the elasticity is--

923
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,700
JONATHAN GRUBER: The
elasticity is low because?

924
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,375
AUDIENCE: Because
they have to do it.

925
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,750
JONATHAN GRUBER:
They have to go.

926
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,640
If you're going to buy two
days before, you got to go.

927
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,613
If you're buying six
months before, you know,

928
00:42:13,613 --> 00:42:15,030
you might have to
go that day, you

929
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,280
might not have to go that day.

930
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,720
You might have to-- but if
you're buying last minute,

931
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,280
you've got to go so
your elasticity's lower.

932
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,860
So price discriminating
monopolists

933
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,950
look for signals of elasticity.

934
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,570
That's their search.

935
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,030
They can't literally know
your willingness to pay.

936
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,280
Amazon tried, but even
Amazon couldn't perfectly

937
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,790
know your willingness to pay.

938
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:39,200
So they're looking for
signals that are correlated

939
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,700
with your willingness to pay.

940
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,098
One signal is whether you want
to fly at the last minute.

941
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:45,640
That means you have
a low elasticity.

942
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,015
You're screwed,
you've got to go.

943
00:42:47,015 --> 00:42:48,910
What's another
thing airlines do?

944
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,910
What's another signal of
elasticity the airlines use?

945
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:53,990
How else-- yeah.

946
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,600
AUDIENCE: How long have
you been on the website?

947
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,080
JONATHAN GRUBER: They don't--

948
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,640
I don't know if they actually
use that, how long you

949
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,240
been on the website.

950
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,700
They could, that would
be kind of interesting.

951
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

952
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,950
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Yeah, I don't know.

953
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,280
But that, that's pretty subtle.

954
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,050
What's a more blunt one they
used even before websites?

955
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:08,680
Yeah?

956
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,730
AUDIENCE: Search history?

957
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,290
JONATHAN GRUBER: No,
even before search--

958
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,370
I know you guys grew
up with internet

959
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,070
but there was life
before the internet.

960
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:16,090
And even before the internet,
airlines price discriminated.

961
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,110
What did they--
what did they do?

962
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:17,860
In the back, yeah.

963
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,060
AUDIENCE: You have, like
business class and--

964
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,435
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, different
levels of flight, right?

965
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:24,130
Why is a first class ticket
more than a coach ticket?

966
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,998
Because rich guys are less
elastic than poor guys.

967
00:43:27,998 --> 00:43:30,040
So basically, another way
of price discriminating

968
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,730
within the same flight is
by having different quality.

969
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,590
So what they do
is they say, we're

970
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,390
going to give you a
higher quality product,

971
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:41,120
but look, first class business--
so I flew business class

972
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,370
for the first time in my life.

973
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:42,880
I was very exciting.

974
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,505
I went to India, I
flew business class.

975
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:45,940
It was awesome.

976
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,730
But it raised the price of the
ticket from $1,000 to $2,500.

977
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,530
Now, it was better but
it wasn't $1,500 better.

978
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,870
Or [INAUDIBLE] put this,
let me rephrase that.

979
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,790
It cost more, but it's certainly
didn't cost $1,500 more.

980
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,210
I got a bigger
seat, and like, you

981
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,750
know, people slaved over me.

982
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,620
But like, it certainly
did not cost them $1,500

983
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,620
to provide that service.

984
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,830
They clearly made more of a
markup on the business class

985
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,350
seat than they did
in the coach seat

986
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,620
because I was less elastic.

987
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,120
Why?

988
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,200
Because someone else was
paying for my flight,

989
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,360
OK, so as less elastic.

990
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,763
And that's-- if you talk to
people in business class,

991
00:44:19,763 --> 00:44:21,680
none of them are paying
for their own flights.

992
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,822
They're either super rich or
their company's paying, OK?

993
00:44:24,822 --> 00:44:26,780
So the bottom line, that's
another way airlines

994
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,100
[INAUDIBLE].

995
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,030
Let's get away from airlines.

996
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,710
What are other examples
of price discrimination?

997
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,347
Yeah.

998
00:44:30,347 --> 00:44:32,430
AUDIENCE: Isn't that a
common thing, like, Google,

999
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,460
like, [INAUDIBLE] actually
use your search history

1000
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,110
and cookies to, like, figure
out how much money you make

1001
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,230
and how much you're willing
to spend on certain items?

1002
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:39,250
JONATHAN GRUBER: I think--

1003
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,208
I have to look this up.

1004
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:42,100
I think they're not
allowed to do that.

1005
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,760
They're allowed to do that
in targeting advertising,

1006
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,135
but I don't know if they're
allowed to setting the price.

1007
00:44:47,135 --> 00:44:48,593
I don't know if a
company's allowed

1008
00:44:48,593 --> 00:44:50,200
to that setting the price.

1009
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,860
Yeah?

1010
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:56,180
AUDIENCE: Sometimes chains will
be more expensive in cities

1011
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,870
and less expensive
in rural areas.

1012
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,440
Like, the same meal
at McDonald's can

1013
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,023
cost a different
amount depending on--

1014
00:45:01,023 --> 00:45:02,300
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly, or--

1015
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,320
that's exactly right.

1016
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,910
Restaurants or supermarkets.

1017
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:10,760
Now here's what's interesting,
if you look at a McDonald's,

1018
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,880
OK, its prices--

1019
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,450
no, it's true for both.

1020
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,270
Basically, if you look
like, like if I buy--

1021
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:21,220
when I buy McDonald's on the
highway out in the suburbs

1022
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,140
it's more expensive than I
would buy here in Cambridge.

1023
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,610
Why is that?

1024
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,768
Why is-- why is a big so-- yeah?

1025
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:29,310
AUDIENCE: Not a lot
of other options.

1026
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:29,670
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

1027
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,570
I'm like, I'm driving.

1028
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,210
Where am I going to go?

1029
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,630
I can't say, oh, it's too
expensive, I'm going next door.

1030
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,770
So that's an example.

1031
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,150
Inner city price-- supermarkets
charge much higher prices

1032
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,940
in the city than
out of the city.

1033
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,348
Now you might think that's
sort of strange, OK?

1034
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:45,890
But that's because
in the city people

1035
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:46,670
have to walk to get there.

1036
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:47,650
They don't have
a lot of options.

1037
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:48,900
There's not a lot of shopping.

1038
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,980
Outside, they can drive from
supermarket to supermarket, OK?

1039
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,100
So there's all these complicated
things that go into it.

1040
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,470
One of my-- let me
sort of tell you

1041
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,340
a couple of my
favorite examples.

1042
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,325
One of my favorite examples
is early bird specials.

1043
00:46:02,325 --> 00:46:03,950
Now you guys might
not know about this,

1044
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,950
but you might've hung out
with your grandparents

1045
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,270
and known that, like, if
you go to a restaurant

1046
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:11,660
sometimes before 5 o'clock
or 5:30, it's cheaper.

1047
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:15,820
Or if you go to a matinee
movie, a movie during the day

1048
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,030
is cheaper than
a movie at night.

1049
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,900
Same movie, why?

1050
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,400
Why is a movie during the day
cheaper than a movie at night?

1051
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:25,968
Yeah.

1052
00:46:25,968 --> 00:46:27,426
AUDIENCE: Because
in the night time

1053
00:46:27,426 --> 00:46:28,920
you probably want
to go to the movies

1054
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,212
more because you're off work
and you have things to do.

1055
00:46:31,212 --> 00:46:32,960
And so there's like--

1056
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,880
like, if you went
early you're purposely

1057
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,350
looking for a cheaper option.

1058
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,440
So you [INAUDIBLE].

1059
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,900
JONATHAN GRUBER: You're
more elastic during the day

1060
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,610
because basically you're
an old retired person's

1061
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,410
who's got nothing but
time in their hands.

1062
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,327
It's like, you can shop
around movie theaters,

1063
00:46:44,327 --> 00:46:47,600
you decide to go to movie
or take a nap, et cetera.

1064
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,400
Same thing with early
dinner specials.

1065
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,070
People who have more time
to shop are more elastic.

1066
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,940
At night you're going
out to see the movie.

1067
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,275
These are people, you know--

1068
00:46:55,275 --> 00:46:56,900
in some sense it's
sort of interesting.

1069
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,810
You think midnight movies--

1070
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:59,600
I don't know if this is
true, midnight movies

1071
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,830
should charge and most of all.

1072
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,570
Because that's a bunch of
insane fans, right, who

1073
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,743
have to see the movie first.

1074
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:06,160
It seems like the midnight
showing should charge the most.

1075
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:06,780
I don't know if that's true.

1076
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,550
That would be
interesting to look at.

1077
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,990
OK, that's one example.

1078
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,500
Another example I
love is Disneyland.

1079
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,320
Disneyland and Disney
World charge less

1080
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,770
if you live within 20
or so miles of the park.

1081
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,863
Why?

1082
00:47:20,863 --> 00:47:22,030
Because you can go whenever.

1083
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,420
So when I took my kids to Disney
World, if I went up and said,

1084
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,378
I'm sorry kids, it was
$10 more than I thought,

1085
00:47:26,378 --> 00:47:29,500
we're not going, I would
have had a riot on my hands.

1086
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,202
Once you're there,
you're inelastic.

1087
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:32,410
You're going to Disney World.

1088
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,993
There's nothing else
to do in Orlando.

1089
00:47:33,993 --> 00:47:36,280
I mean, but there's
other parks, I guess.

1090
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,200
But like, but if you
live locally you can

1091
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,570
decide whether to go or not.

1092
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,450
And then probably the most
interesting recent example

1093
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,710
is Tesla.

1094
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:48,430
So during-- I feel like, did
I tell you guys the Tesla

1095
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,990
hurricane story yet?

1096
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,990
I don't think so, right?

1097
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,160
OK, so during the
hurricane in Florida--

1098
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,190
Irma, I guess it was?

1099
00:47:55,190 --> 00:48:00,350
In Florida, Tesla-- so Tesla
so two cars, two models,

1100
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:03,350
the cheaper model and
the more expensive model.

1101
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,780
And the more expensive
model had some nice doodads,

1102
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,020
but most importantly the
battery lasted longer.

1103
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,060
The cheaper model
was like 300 miles,

1104
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,610
the more expensive model
was like 500 miles.

1105
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:19,460
During hurricane Irma, Tesla
as a gesture of goodwill said,

1106
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,740
hey guys who drive
the cheap car,

1107
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,720
you can now drive 500 miles.

1108
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,420
And they're like, what the
hell, it's the same battery?

1109
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,250
Tesla said, well it turns
out, it's the same battery.

1110
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,000
The only difference
is a piece of software

1111
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,710
that we can turn off or on.

1112
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,920
So why did Tesla do that?

1113
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,810
Why did Tesla have a piece of
software they turn off or on

1114
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:45,230
and turn it off for some
people to make them drive less?

1115
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,660
Why did they do that?

1116
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,950
There's someone else involved.

1117
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,592
Can anyone tell me
about what Tesla

1118
00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:51,800
thought, meaning besides
the, oh, must be an asshole.

1119
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,300
What else?

1120
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,930
What's the other--
what's the kind of--

1121
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,520
what's Tesla's thought process?

1122
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,270
Actually, it was
perfect economics.

1123
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:58,780
Yeah?

1124
00:48:58,780 --> 00:48:59,300
AUDIENCE: Price discrimination.

1125
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,670
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right,
it's price discrimination.

1126
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,697
But how?

1127
00:49:01,697 --> 00:49:04,030
How are you price discriminating
by making some people--

1128
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,170
yeah?

1129
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:09,018
AUDIENCE: You can make a
500 mile car more expensive.

1130
00:49:09,018 --> 00:49:10,060
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

1131
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,743
It's like first class.

1132
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:13,660
You're basically saying,
I want to charge more

1133
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,112
for a better product.

1134
00:49:15,112 --> 00:49:16,820
I can't charge more
for the same product,

1135
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,840
so if I give everyone 500
miles I can't charge more.

1136
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,950
But by making one product
better I can separate demand.

1137
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,620
I can sell the expensive product
to the low elasticity of demand

1138
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,480
consumers and the less
expensive to the high

1139
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,470
elasticity of demand.

1140
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,370
But it's actually the same damn
product, I just did it as a way

1141
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,090
to price discriminate.

1142
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:37,930
So Tesla, in an
effort to be nice,

1143
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,760
screwed themselves by revealing
that they had been actually

1144
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,625
falsely screw-- you
know screwing consumers.

1145
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:44,500
It's not [INAUDIBLE]----
it's good economics.

1146
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,190
It makes total sense.

1147
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:48,950
OK, this actually
follows one last example.

1148
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:52,120
When the first laser
printers came out,

1149
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,320
OK, it turned out
that you could buy one

1150
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,740
for home that was like half
the price one for office.

1151
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,990
And someone took them apart
and found the one for home

1152
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:02,600
was the one for the office
plus an extra piece that

1153
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,500
made it go slower.

1154
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,113
And they did that
simply because they

1155
00:50:08,113 --> 00:50:10,530
knew the office guys were less
price elastic than the home

1156
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:11,270
guys.

1157
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,810
So they wanted an expensive
one-- so they said,

1158
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,810
the office one's faster.

1159
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,580
Isn't this cool?

1160
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,955
It was faster because they
didn't add an extra piece that

1161
00:50:16,955 --> 00:50:18,247
made to go slower, OK?

1162
00:50:18,247 --> 00:50:19,330
And that's the same thing.

1163
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,512
So let's stop there,
and we'll come back

1164
00:50:21,512 --> 00:50:22,470
and talk more monopoly.

1165
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:26,310
Good luck tomorrow night
and we'll talk more

1166
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,760
about monopoly on Wednesday.
