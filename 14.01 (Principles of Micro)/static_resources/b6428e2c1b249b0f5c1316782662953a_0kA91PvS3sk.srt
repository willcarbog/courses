JONATHAN GRUBER: All right,
why don't we get started?

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,600
Today we're going to move
on to, finally, the most

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,340
realistic market structure.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,260
We talked about perfectly
competitive markets.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,680
Now, that was a very
useful, extreme example

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,952
to help us think about
economic efficiency.

10
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:29,910
We then flipped over to
talk about the somewhat

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,009
more real estate
case of monopoly,

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,550
but still, very few markets
have only one participant.

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,940
A true monopoly is rare
in the private market.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,000
What most markets are
marked by are probably

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,580
more features of
oligopoly, which

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,840
is a market with a small
group of firms competing

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,980
with each other, but with
barriers to entry that keep out

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,833
an unlimited number of firms.

19
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,250
Think about these
as markets where

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,990
there are some
barriers to entry,

21
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,270
so firms just can't
consciously enter and exit

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,570
like they could in
our IBM/Dell example,

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,180
but where there's small
enough barriers to entry

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,788
that a few firms have
gotten in, not just one.

25
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:10,080
So it's not a natural monopoly.

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,270
It's not like only one
firm can be in there.

27
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,030
Multiple firms are in
there, but they only

28
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,780
know they have to
compete with each other,

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,600
not with the big, wide world.

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,200
So for example,
the classic example

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,060
of an oligopoly industry
would be the auto industry.

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,393
Auto manufacturers
clearly compete.

33
00:01:26,393 --> 00:01:27,810
Clearly, if you
watch any sporting

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,520
event and watch how much
advertising that goes,

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,270
they're clearly competing
with each other.

36
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,900
They're comparing to
each other all the time.

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,110
But most of the
cars in the world

38
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,660
are produced by fewer than
10 auto manufacturers.

39
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,910
The notion that we have a
perfectly competitive market

40
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,940
of thousands of sellers
selling identical goods

41
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,290
is clearly not right when
it comes to buying a car.

42
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,830
So that's the model we're
going to want to focus on

43
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,820
for the next few lectures.

44
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:59,992
Now, within an oligopoly
market, whenever

45
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:01,450
we think about this
market, we want

46
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,910
to start by noting that
within this market,

47
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,740
these limited sets
of competitors

48
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,730
can behave in two ways.

49
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:15,170
They can behave cooperatively
or non-cooperatively.

50
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,930
Cooperatively
means that they can

51
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,250
form what's called a cartel.

52
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,270
So when there's an
oligopoly market

53
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,380
and the firms cooperatively get
together and make decisions,

54
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,250
that's called the cartel, the
most famous example of which

55
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,130
is OPEC, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries,

56
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,860
which are the set of countries
that control about 2/3

57
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,830
of the world's oil,
led by Saudi Arabia,

58
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,140
is the major player in OPEC.

59
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,080
It's a cartel of
about a dozen nations.

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,170
And what they do is they
control the vast majority

61
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,270
of the world's oil reserves.

62
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,970
And by behaving cooperatively,
they essentially

63
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,610
turn themselves into a monopoly.

64
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,550
OPEC acts as if they've
got the monopoly in oil.

65
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,770
Certainly they used to.

66
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,770
Now it's getting harder.

67
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,180
Other non-OPEC countries are
starting to produce more oil

68
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,610
and it's breaking down.

69
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,590
But for a long time,
they were essentially

70
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,577
the cooperative
producer of oil, and act

71
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:25,910
essential like a monopoly,
and they made lots of profits

72
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,890
like a monopoly.

73
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,413
That kept prices high, they kept
production inefficiently low,

74
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:31,580
and they made lots of money.

75
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,783
However, that's a great
outcome for producers,

76
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:39,200
but as we'll talk
about next time,

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,430
it's actually a hard
outcome to enforce.

78
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,120
Turns out to be hard to
keep cartels together.

79
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,490
And so typically,
oligopoly markets

80
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,130
behave in a non-cooperative
way, with the participants

81
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,750
competing with each other, not
cooperating with each other.

82
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,060
In this case, you can actually
get them driving their profits

83
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,970
down far below the
monopoly level,

84
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,610
and indeed, perhaps even all the
way to the competitive level.

85
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,860
So you can think about markets
as a competitive as one

86
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,260
extreme and the monopoly
as the other extreme,

87
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,090
oligopoly in between.

88
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,250
A cooperative oligopoly
market, like cartel,

89
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,940
will end up close to
the monopoly outcome.

90
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,998
A non-cooperative market will
end up somewhere in between,

91
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:21,040
and we're going to model
today's where in between

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,010
do they end up.

93
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,820
Now, to think about
this, we're going

94
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,090
to have to turn to a
tool, which has really

95
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,460
become a dominant tool in
economics over the last 40

96
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,370
years, which is the
tool of game theory.

97
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,390
Game theory.

98
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,060
So basically, we're going
to think of oligopoly firms

99
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,700
as engaging in a game.

100
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:57,210
And as with any game, you
need to know two things.

101
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,090
One is you need to
what's the strategy,

102
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,610
and the second is you need to
know when is the game over.

103
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,326
What's the equilibrium?

104
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,590
And that's, essentially,
what you do with any game.

105
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,870
And so basically, the
key with game theory

106
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,290
is that we are going to
find the equilibrium,

107
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,330
and that's going to
yield for us the strategy

108
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,950
that players are going to use.

109
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,295
However, equilibrium in a
game is not well-defined.

110
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:34,670
It's not like a
set of rules that

111
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,380
are printed out, like monopoly.

112
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,550
In a non-cooperative oligopoly
market, the equilibrium,

113
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,050
you have to actually come up
with different concepts of what

114
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,770
equilibrium is.

115
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,470
There's not a hard and
fast scientific rule.

116
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,450
And the typical
one that's used is

117
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:57,140
called the Nash equilibrium,
the Nash equilibrium,

118
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,188
named for John Nash, the famous
mathematician, who economists

119
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:04,355
have claimed as their own,
even though he was really

120
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:05,230
a mathematician.

121
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,760
But we gave him the
Nobel Prize anyway.

122
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,590
And if you think of
economists, probably

123
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,757
one of the most famous, you
all know about the movie

124
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:14,510
and book Beautiful Mind.

125
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,720
He is based on the
father of game theory.

126
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,290
So basically, what is
the Nash equilibrium?

127
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:30,220
The Nash equilibrium is defined
as the point at which no player

128
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,520
wants to change their
strategy, given what

129
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,580
the other players are doing.

130
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,710
So the point at which no player
wants to change its strategy,

131
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,490
given what the other
players are doing.

132
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,480
So in other words, every player
is happy with where they are.

133
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,490
Given what every other
player's decided,

134
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,410
I'm happy to do
what I've decided.

135
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,350
So I've got a strategy,
and given the strategy

136
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,250
other players are using, if I'm
happy with my strategy, then

137
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,640
that's in equilibrium.

138
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,120
So this is a super
abstract concept,

139
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,340
so let's illustrate
it with an example.

140
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,040
And the classic
example of game theory

141
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,350
is the prisoner's dilemma,
which many of you, I'm sure,

142
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,362
know about, maybe
the most of you,

143
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:19,570
but let's just go through it.

144
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,210
This is the thing from the
old cop movies you see,

145
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,730
where they arrest two guys and
they put them in separate rooms

146
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,920
and they basically
interrogate them separately.

147
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,042
They're put in separate rooms,
and let's say that these guys

148
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,000
get told the following.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,670
They each get told separately
the following thing.

150
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,410
They get told that right
now, if nothing else happens,

151
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,260
there's enough evidence to send
them each away for one year.

152
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:55,000
However, they're told, if
they turned on their friend

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and say their friend's
guilty, then they go free

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,620
and their friend
gets five years.

155
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,010
If their friend turns on them,
then the friend goes free

156
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,820
and they get five years.

157
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,500
But if they both turn on each
other, they both get two years.

158
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,590
Set up as if they both stay
silent, they both get one year.

159
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,380
If one turns, then that
person gets to leave

160
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,070
and the person gets five years.

161
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,250
But if they both turn, then
they each get two years.

162
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,040
So how do we think
about decision-making

163
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,010
in that context?

164
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,720
The way we do that is we write
down, we call, a payoff matrix.

165
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,690
We write down in matrix
form this decision.

166
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,940
So let's think about what a
playoff matrix looks like.

167
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,809
Up here is prisoner
B, and here you

168
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:48,020
have prisoner A. Prisoner A.
And prisoner A can remain silent

169
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,210
or they can talk, and
prisoner B can remain silent

170
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,080
or they can talk.

171
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,390
And then we just
write down, what

172
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,760
are the outcomes,
or the payoffs,

173
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,932
from these different strategies?

174
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:07,190
So prisoner A says nothing
and prisoner B says nothing,

175
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,900
then A gets one year
and B gets one year.

176
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,290
If prisoner A says nothing
and prisoner B says, oh yeah,

177
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,360
prisoner A is
definitely guilty, then

178
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,620
prisoner A gets five years
and prisoner gets zero years.

179
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,230
If the opposite happens,
if prison A says,

180
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,170
yeah, B's guilty, and B
doesn't say anything about A,

181
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,980
then A gets zero years
and B gets five years.

182
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,212
But if they both say
the other one's guilty,

183
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:37,420
then they each get two years.

184
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,095
OK, that's the payoff matrix.

185
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,320
And now we want to ask,
given this payoff matrix,

186
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,820
what is the right strategy
for each prisoner to pursue?

187
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,730
And the way we do this in the
Nash equilibrium concept is we

188
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,940
look for a dominant strategy.

189
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,520
Is there a strategy that
I would pursue regardless

190
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,913
of what the other person does?

191
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:08,330
And if there is,
I'll pursue that.

192
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,247
Because remember, the
Nash equilibrium concept

193
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:13,010
is, what do I want to do, given
what the other person is doing?

194
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,802
If I have a strategy
I want to do no matter

195
00:10:14,802 --> 00:10:17,050
what the other person is
doing, then I'll do it.

196
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,790
So when asked, is there
a dominant strategy?

197
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,960
Is there a strategy that is
the best thing to do, no matter

198
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,210
what the other guy does?

199
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,765
Well, clearly, if
they're cooperating,

200
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:32,390
if these were stupid police and
they sat them in the same room,

201
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,170
told them and then left, the
two guys could cooperate.

202
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,810
Well, clearly, the dominant
cooperative strategy

203
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,485
is for both of us
to remain silent.

204
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:42,110
That's the dominant
cooperate strategy.

205
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,420
And as a team, we only
get two total years

206
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,360
in jail, where everything
gets many more years in jail.

207
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,000
So if they're buddies
and they trust each other

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,022
and they cooperate, then that's
clearly the right strategy.

209
00:10:53,022 --> 00:10:54,980
But let's say the police
are smart and put them

210
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,850
in separate rooms.

211
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,290
Well, what's the dominant
non-cooperative strategy?

212
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,690
What is the strategy that A
or B, say A, should produce?

213
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah?

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,020
Why?

215
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,490
AUDIENCE: Either way, you're
going to get less years.

216
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,615
Like if you're the only
person silent and you talk,

217
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:14,170
you get zero, and if
they talk and you talk,

218
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,468
you only get two versus five.

219
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:16,510
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

220
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,240
For prisoner A in
this first row--

221
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,050
compare the first column.

222
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,240
We'll say prisoner B is silent.

223
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,250
Then clearly, you're
better off talking than not

224
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,420
talking, zero rather than one.

225
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,240
Let's say prisoner B talks.

226
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,880
Then you're still better off
talking than not talking.

227
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,750
So no matter what B
does, you should talk.

228
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,190
Likewise, prisoner B, no matter
what A does, B should talk.

229
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,870
So the non-cooperative
equilibrium

230
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,450
is actually this outcome.

231
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,280
They both end up talking.

232
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,400
You get sort of a
race to the bottom.

233
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,222
The non-cooperative
outcome is much worse

234
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:53,680
than if they could
have cooperated.

235
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,360
So basically, what
you get is that

236
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,120
the non-cooperative
equilibrium is always

237
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,810
worse for the players than
the cooperative equilibrium.

238
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,940
And this was like an
unbelievable insight of Nash.

239
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,880
Before Nash, we always
thought competition

240
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,640
was always and everywhere good.

241
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,990
We always thought more
competition is better,

242
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,300
for the reasons we talked
in the first 10 or 12

243
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,190
lectures of this class.

244
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,112
Nash was the first one
to say, no, actually,

245
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:26,070
competition can be bad.

246
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,153
Cooperation can be better.

247
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:29,670
I don't know if you remember
the scene in a Beautiful Mind

248
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,650
where they're picking
up girls in the bar.

249
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,670
And he described
basically a Nash strategy,

250
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,070
how competition will lead
to the worst outcome.

251
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,180
And basically, that's
what you see here,

252
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,465
that competition can
actually lead to a worse

253
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:45,340
outcome than cooperation,
and that was really

254
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,900
Nash's brilliant insight.

255
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:57,660
Now, this is a cute example
with prisoners, but actually--

256
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,000
well first, two points.

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,260
First of all, this
generally shows you

258
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,070
how you do gain favor
with Nash equilibrium.

259
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,040
Basically, you look
at the payoff matrix,

260
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,860
you find the dominant
strategy, and then

261
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,710
you find where those dominant
strategies intersect.

262
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,210
And here, the
dominant strategies

263
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,040
intersect at this
cell, therefore

264
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,990
that's the equilibrium.

265
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,860
So that's basically how you do
game theory in a game theory

266
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,850
kindergarten level.

267
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,930
You look at the matrix.

268
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,090
You find each player's
dominant strategy.

269
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,700
And you find the point at
which those dominant strategies

270
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,160
intersect, and at that point,
that's the equilibrium.

271
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,710
Now, that's all well and good
for a simple example like this,

272
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,410
but let's actually apply
to an economics example.

273
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,690
Let's think about advertising.

274
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,160
So think about Coke and Pepsi.

275
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,230
Right now, let's think about
their decision to advertise.

276
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,910
Now, obviously it's
a simple problem.

277
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,130
Obviously Pepsi
should just be illegal

278
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,370
because Coke is way better.

279
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,330
But sadly, it's not, and
sometimes I have to drink Pepsi

280
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,770
and I'm very sad.

281
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,010
But nonetheless, in the real
world, we have Coke and Pepsi

282
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,230
and they have to decide
how much to advertise.

283
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,130
Now, the dominant
cooperative strategy

284
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,770
would be to say,
look, advertising

285
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,820
costs us a ton of money.

286
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,430
Let's just split the market.

287
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,722
Let's have a monopoly
market and just split it.

288
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:24,180
We're close to
splitting it anyway.

289
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,130
Coke's got some more of it.

290
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:25,830
We're close to splitting it.

291
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,460
Let's just split it.

292
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,115
Yeah?

293
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,815
AUDIENCE: Can you
actually do that?

294
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:30,070
JONATHAN GRUBER: What?

295
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,280
AUDIENCE: Can you
actually do that?

296
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,070
Because I remember,
there were places

297
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,590
that you get where
you aren't allowed

298
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,630
to sell in the same place.

299
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,255
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK, but that's
different than the cooperative.

300
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:38,810
That's imposed not by
Coke and Pepsi jointly.

301
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,180
That's imposed by Pepsi
saying to a university campus,

302
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,050
for example, we will
cut you a better deal

303
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,882
if you'll agree
not to sell Coke.

304
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:47,840
That's not cooperation.

305
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,760
That's competition.

306
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,300
So there's cooperative strategy.

307
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,660
What if they don't cooperate?

308
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,460
Well, let's imagine we have
the following payoff matrix.

309
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,630
You've got Pepsi up here,
and they can advertise or not

310
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,860
advertise.

311
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,490
And you've got Coke here,
and they can advertise or not

312
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,260
advertise.

313
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,485
And let's say the payoff
matrix is the following.

314
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,480
Let's say the total amount
of profit to be made

315
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,640
is 16 whatever,
billion, whatever

316
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,670
units you want to
make it, $16 billion.

317
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,100
And let's say if there's
no advertising, Coke gets 8

318
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,717
and Pepsi gets 8.

319
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,370
But let's say
advertising costs money.

320
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,700
It costs 5, $5 billion.

321
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,340
So let's say if
they both advertise,

322
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,620
then they still end up
splitting the market,

323
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,550
but they only make 3.

324
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,370
C equals 3, P equals 3.

325
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,540
I'm sorry, advertise.
yes, you're right.

326
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,230
C equals 3, P equals 3.

327
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,425
And here C equals 8, P equals 8.

328
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,880
So basically, you
have a situation

329
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,200
where they both end of
splitting the market either way,

330
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,590
but they just split a smaller
net profit if they advertise.

331
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,290
So clearly, they'd
rather be here than here.

332
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,330
But what happens in the
off diagonal elements?

333
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:35,220
Well, let's say also that if
Coke advertises but Pepsi does

334
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,050
not, then let's say Coke
ends up making $13 billion

335
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,120
and Pepsi ends up making minus--

336
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,640
I'm sorry, if Coke advertises
and Pepsi does not,

337
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,510
they split money.

338
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,700
And Pepsi makes negative 2.

339
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,950
They actually lose money
because they have fixed costs

340
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,700
and they don't sell anything.

341
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,500
Nobody buys Pepsi.

342
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,065
It'll lose money.

343
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:57,440
And let's say if
Pepsi advertises

344
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,770
and Coke doesn't, then
Coke makes negative 2

345
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,000
and Pepsi makes 13.

346
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,710
So actually, if you
don't advertise,

347
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,800
you're really screwed, and the
other guy is really screwed.

348
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:07,980
Yeah?

349
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,930
AUDIENCE: Does this include
the cost of advertising?

350
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,347
JONATHAN GRUBER:
This does include

351
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:12,890
the cost of advertising.

352
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:18,220
But it's just Coke gets a huge
market, expands its market.

353
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,220
So now let's play the game.

354
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,170
Well, now let's say you're Coke.

355
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:30,973
You say, well, if I advertise
and Pepsi advertises, I make 3.

356
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:32,890
But if I don't advertise
and Pepsi advertises,

357
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,640
I make negative 2.

358
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,730
So I should advertise.

359
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,700
If I advertise and Pepsi
doesn't advertise, I make 13.

360
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,180
If I don't advertise and Pepsi
doesn't advertise, I make 8.

361
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,630
So either way, my dominant
strategy is to advertise.

362
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,730
And likewise, Pepsi
does the same thing.

363
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,110
I screwed up writing this
compared to my notes,

364
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,380
but it's good because
it shows you--

365
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,380
I flipped the matrix, but
the logic is the same.

366
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,660
It helps you not just
memorize cells of the matrix

367
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,980
but learn the logic.

368
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,700
The point is either way,
the dominant strategy

369
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,750
is to advertise, so
they both advertise.

370
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,430
So real world example
of how you can end up.

371
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,470
Now, so much of Pepsi
and Coke do this.

372
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,060
Actually, there was an
industry that did this.

373
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,870
So when I was a kid, you never,
ever saw ads for liquor on TV.

374
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,200
There were beer ads and wine
ads, but no hard alcohol ad.

375
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,440
No bourbon, no whiskey,
no nothing, gin.

376
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,870
All these Captain
Morgan's ads we see now,

377
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,020
they didn't exist
when I was a kid.

378
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,520
But it wasn't because the law.

379
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,880
It was because the hard liquor
industry cooperatively agreed

380
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,300
none of them would advertise.

381
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,690
So they actually imposed
the cooperative equilibrium,

382
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,747
and then that broke down.

383
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,580
I don't know the story
of how it broke down.

384
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,180
But it broke down.

385
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,013
Now they all advertise,
and they're probably

386
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:43,360
all worse off than they were
when they didn't advertise.

387
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,610
We'll talk next time about
why it probably broke down.

388
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,780
I don't know the stories.

389
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,347
I have a rough sense, and we'll
talk about that next time.

390
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:51,930
But this is the point of how a
non-cooperative equilibrium can

391
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,840
drive you to a bad outcome.

392
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,260
Now, basically,
this doesn't just

393
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,730
apply to prisoners
or businesses.

394
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,688
It applies to people, too.

395
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:03,480
So let's say poor Hector
back there has had

396
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,190
a fight with his girlfriend.

397
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,622
And they've had a big fight.

398
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:08,830
They've going a little while.

399
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,360
They've had a big fight.

400
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,090
And Hector has got to decide,
do I apologize or do I wait

401
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,010
for her to apologize?

402
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,770
Well, the last
thing Hector wants

403
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,470
is to go up there and apologize
and have her say, forget it.

404
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,940
I'm breaking up with you.

405
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,000
That'd be the worst.

406
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,400
If he knows she's going to
be like, oh, I'm sorry, too,

407
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,850
then he'd be happy to do it.

408
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,940
But what if he goes, no
I'm breaking up with you,

409
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,720
and she's thinking
the same thing.

410
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,580
So what happens, they break up.

411
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,900
We've been through this
many times in our lives.

412
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,060
This is the
non-cooperative strategy.

413
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,560
Basically, if you know what the
other person is going to do,

414
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,970
your dominant strategies to be
an asshole, and basically that

415
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,720
happens a lot in the
context of the real world.

416
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,280
So now we have this
sad-sounding outcome,

417
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,700
that basically game theory leads
to bad outcomes for producers,

418
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,060
at least.

419
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,470
But this is what's
exciting about game theory.

420
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,380
So when I went to
grad school, back

421
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,530
when dinosaurs roamed
the earth, game theory

422
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,980
was taught barely
in the sequence.

423
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,270
It was like an extra
course, taught a little bit.

424
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,400
Now it dominates the teaching
of microeconomics, in economics.

425
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,380
And it doesn't dominate, but
it's a whole like component

426
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,750
of our core
microeconomics education,

427
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,510
because it's given such
a cool set of tools

428
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,040
to think about these decisions.

429
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,090
Now, I can't give you even 1%
of the flavor of game theory.

430
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,910
If you want to learn more, I
highly suggest you take 1412,

431
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,190
which our game theory class,
and you can learn a ton.

432
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,982
But let me show you
one interesting wrinkle

433
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:43,590
of the things game theory
can do, to go beyond this.

434
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,690
And that's to imagine that Coke
and Pepsi are not playing a one

435
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,980
shot game, but a repeated game.

436
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,110
Repeated game.

437
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:07,250
So now imagine that Coke
says to Pepsi the following,

438
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:13,440
I promise to not advertise as
long as you don't advertise.

439
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,245
But if you ever advertise,
I will advertise forever.

440
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:19,620
Coke says to Pepsi,
I promise not

441
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,390
to advertise as long
as you don't advertise,

442
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,930
but if I ever catch
you advertising,

443
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,770
I'm going to advertise forever.

444
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,610
So think about Pepsi
choice in period 1.

445
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,050
Pepsi's choice in period 1.

446
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,972
In period 1, they could
say, ha, stupid Coke.

447
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:35,430
I'm going to jump
on and advertise.

448
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,380
They promised not to advertise.

449
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:45,440
So if Pepsi advertises, they're
going to make 13 in period 1

450
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,200
because Coke's taken
themselves off to the side.

451
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,857
But after period 1, they're
going to make 8 forever.

452
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:55,440
No, I'm sorry.

453
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,720
They're going to make 3 forever.

454
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,860
Because Coke's
going to advertise.

455
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,985
They're going to advertise.

456
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:03,177
They break down to the
non-cooperative equilibrium,

457
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,010
if Pepsi advertises.

458
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,710
Now, what if Pepsi
doesn't advertise?

459
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,590
As long as it doesn't advertise,
then it gets to deal with Coke,

460
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,850
so it makes 8 forever.

461
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,495
We'll talk later in the course
about how you combine numbers

462
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:19,370
that happen at different
times, but trust me,

463
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,390
8 forever is a way better
deal than 13, than 3 forever.

464
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,810
So actually, by having
this be a repeated game,

465
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,730
Coke has solved the
prisoner's dilemma.

466
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,790
It's essentially imposed
a cooperative equilibrium

467
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,490
on the problem.

468
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,950
So that's how repeated
game can fix this.

469
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,890
But-- this is where the game
gets really exciting-- that

470
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,570
only works if this
game never ends,

471
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,610
because once Coke
or Pepsi thinks

472
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,510
there's an end to the game,
the entire thing breaks down.

473
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,630
So imagine, for example, that
Coke makes the offer to Pepsi,

474
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,310
but Pepsi is worried
that in 10 years,

475
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,007
the government is
going to outlaw soda.

476
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:03,340
The government said, look,
we're heading that direction.

477
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,635
Soda is going to be
illegal in 10 years,

478
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:06,760
so I don't want to do this.

479
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,500
I'm sorry, I have
that in my mind.

480
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,230
So Coke offers the deal
now, what do I think?

481
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,000
Well, let's think about Pepsi's
decision in the ninth year.

482
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,900
They've made 8, 8, 8, 8,
8, and they get to year 9.

483
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:28,110
Now in year 9, they know that
next year there's no more game.

484
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,370
So what should they do?

485
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:30,970
Advertise.

486
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,750
Grab the 13 in the last period,
because Coke can't punish them

487
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,360
because the game's over.

488
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,670
But Coke knows this.

489
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,950
So what's Coke going to
do in the ninth year?

490
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,860
Advertise.

491
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,000
It's going to advertise, so
they're both going to make 3.

492
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,465
Well, if Pepsi
knows Coke's going

493
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:51,550
to advertise in the ninth
year no matter what,

494
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,640
what should Pepsi
in the eighth year?

495
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,475
Advertise.

496
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,350
And if Coke knows Pepsi
is going to advertise

497
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,017
in the eighth year,
what should Coke do?

498
00:23:58,017 --> 00:24:00,750
And so on, and it ends up that
they both advertise all the way

499
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,480
through.

500
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,430
So the game breaks
down if it's an end.

501
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,535
This is really kind
of neat, and this

502
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:07,910
is what game theory
is all about,

503
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,350
is how do you think
through these more

504
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,210
complicated scenarios that
are much more complicated

505
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,680
than the prisoner's
dilemma, and actually

506
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,360
think about how firms and
individuals might actually

507
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,860
behave?

508
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,904
Yeah?

509
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:18,196
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it also
be advantageous if they just

510
00:24:18,196 --> 00:24:20,780
advertised the first year
instead of these contracts,

511
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,010
kind of what we were
talking about earlier?

512
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,100
JONATHAN GRUBER: Sure.

513
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,380
And once again, that's
what you cover in a field

514
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,380
course like game theory.

515
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,382
What about alternative
forms of contracting,

516
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:30,840
with exclusionary
contracting, what

517
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,952
we call tying in contracting?

518
00:24:32,952 --> 00:24:34,160
That's great, and they would.

519
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,890
But that's why you
got to take 1412, OK?

520
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,390
Yeah?

521
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:41,510
AUDIENCE: Would it
be a better outcome

522
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,845
if they cooperated and switched
periods of advertising?

523
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:49,022
Like for the first period,
they get 13, they get minus 2.

524
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:50,480
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Yeah, the way I've

525
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,188
set this problem up,
if they could commit

526
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:54,050
to that, that would be right.

527
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,670
But you'd have to commit to it.

528
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,090
Because then the period that
Pepsi promised to take off,

529
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,700
if they actually advertised that
period, then Coke's screwed.

530
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,730
So that would work as a
repeated game solution,

531
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,230
but it wouldn't work as
a non-repeating game.

532
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,760
It would work as an infinite
repeated game but not

533
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,290
a non-infinite repeated game.

534
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,255
Good question.

535
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:16,310
OK, other questions?

536
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,367
All right, so that's the
basis of game theory.

537
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:19,950
That's just a taste
for the excitement

538
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,500
that you can learn
with game theory.

539
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,105
But in fact, in
economics, we like

540
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,980
to write those as fun
examples, but we really

541
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,457
prefer to do math.

542
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:28,040
So let's actually
think about the math

543
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,510
of how we take game
theory concepts

544
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,040
and put them in practice.

545
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,880
And the way we do that
is through the concept

546
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,960
of the Cournot model.

547
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,550
The Cournot model of
non-cooperative oligopolies.

548
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,957
So the Cournot model of
non-cooperative oligopoly

549
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:50,290
is the standard workhorse model.

550
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,720
It takes this
intuition and puts it

551
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,340
into the optimizing
math we've been

552
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,630
doing so far in this class.

553
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,030
Now let's imagine
non-cooperative case,

554
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,907
but now let's imagine
not just two choices,

555
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:04,990
but realistically, there's
a whole set of choices.

556
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:13,010
Then how would you
behave in that case?

557
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,240
So let's imagine that
there's two airlines, United

558
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,930
and American.

559
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:23,370
So we have an oligopolistic
two-firm airline industry.

560
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,380
Obviously, the math can
extend to more firms,

561
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,180
but just to start, and I'll
talk about that next lecture.

562
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,780
But for now, imagine a two-firm
industry, United and American.

563
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,280
And because the hub
and spoke system

564
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,200
we discussed last
time, let's imagine

565
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,380
that they're the only two folks
that go from Boston to Chicago.

566
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,910
Because it's hub
and spoke system.

567
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,260
The only folks that go
from Boston to Chicago

568
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,640
are United and American,
and they do, in fact,

569
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,930
dominate that line.

570
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,200
So let's imagine
they're the only folks,

571
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,880
and say no other firms
can compete on this route

572
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,250
because they can't get
slots at the airport.

573
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,310
So the question is,
how do these firms

574
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,450
decide how many flights to run?

575
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,420
It's not just advertise, don't.

576
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,400
It's literally a
continuous decision

577
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,480
of how many flights to run every
day and how much to charge.

578
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,650
They've got to
make that decision.

579
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:11,970
And the Nash equilibrium
here, the subset of Nash,

580
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,790
for this example, is called
the Cournot equilibrium.

581
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:18,010
And the Cournot
equilibrium exists

582
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,380
when a firm chooses
a quantity such

583
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,770
that, given the quantity
chosen by the other firm,

584
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,000
they don't want to change.

585
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,410
So a firm chooses, essentially,
a profit-maximizing quantity,

586
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,640
given the quantity
chosen by the other firm.

587
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,640
And that profit-maximizing
quantity, then you're

588
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,530
in Cournot equilibrium,
if you have

589
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:48,000
chosen a quantity that is
profit-maximizing, given

590
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
what the other firm is doing.

591
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,120
So basically, how do we
actually carry this out?

592
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,480
Let's talk about the steps.

593
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,415
So the first step, I'm
going to talk intuitively

594
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:03,040
about the math, what
we're going to do,

595
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,900
and then I'm going to
talk mathematically

596
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,710
and graph what we actually do.

597
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,580
There's essentially three steps
in solving for the Cournot

598
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,200
equilibrium.

599
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,270
The first is ask how your
demand changes when some of it's

600
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,540
absorbed by other firms.

601
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,320
So the first is solve for
your residual demand function.

602
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,940
What does your demand
curve look like,

603
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,630
given what the other firm does?

604
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,010
That's step 1.

605
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:32,450
Step 2 is then you develop
a marginal revenue, which

606
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:37,930
is a function of the
other firm's quantity.

607
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,750
Little q.

608
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,103
It's multiple firms.

609
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:43,270
The other firm's-- that's
really bad, hard to read--

610
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,312
the other firm's quality.

611
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:46,030
So your marginal
revenue is a function.

612
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,290
Typically, it's a function--

613
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,540
I'm sorry-- of both your
quantity and the other firm's

614
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,740
quantity.

615
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,485
A function of both your quantity
and the other firm's quantity.

616
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:56,110
We develop marginal revenue as
a function of your own quantity.

617
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,190
We know how to do that.

618
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,440
Now we develop a margin as
a function of your quantity

619
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,010
and the other firm's quantity.

620
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,800
Then you simply set
this marginal revenue

621
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,980
equal to marginal
cost, and that delivers

622
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,200
you a conditional answer.

623
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,670
That delivers you your
optimal quantity as a function

624
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,170
of the other firm's quantity.

625
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:21,680
Well, that doesn't do
us a whole lot of good,

626
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,680
except there's two firms.

627
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:32,170
So the fourth step is we do the
same thing for the other firm

628
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,330
and get the same
kind of equation.

629
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,620
Then what do we have?

630
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,840
Two equations and two
unknowns, so we solve.

631
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,440
So what we do here
is essentially

632
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,230
the same thing we did before,
but now your marginal revenue

633
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,650
is not just a function
of your own quantity,

634
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,200
it's a function of the
other guy's quantity.

635
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,430
Same with the other guy.

636
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,222
That gives you two
equations, two unknowns.

637
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:54,740
We solve.

638
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,560
And the point at which
both firms are happy

639
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,562
is the Cournot equilibrium.

640
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,807
That's confusing, so let's
actually look at that.

641
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,890
We'll do this both graphically
and mathematically.

642
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,390
Let's start with figure 13.1.

643
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,260
To make things easy, let's
start by imagining that American

644
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,390
Airlines is a monopoly.

645
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:22,870
Let's start with the world with
an American Airlines monopoly.

646
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:30,250
And let's say that the demand
function is P equals 339

647
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:35,555
minus Q. That's the demand for
flights from Boston to Chicago.

648
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,842
And let's say that the marginal
cost, to make life easier--

649
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,300
it could have a cost function
and make your life difficult,

650
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,890
and maybe someday I'll do that.

651
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,390
But for now, to
make your life easy,

652
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:54,418
let's just say it's a flat
marginal cost of $147.

653
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:56,460
I'm not going to make life
difficult with solving

654
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,840
for marginal cost functions.

655
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,180
For now, it's just a flat
marginal cost of $147.

656
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:05,290
No matter how many flights they
do, it's $147 per passenger.

657
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:09,640
So if you're a monopolist,
how do you solve this problem?

658
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,805
Well, first you derive your
marginal revenue function.

659
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:14,430
Well, what's marginal
revenue function?

660
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:21,840
Well, revenues is P times Q,
which is 339 minus q squared.

661
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,607
So your marginal revenue
function is 339 minus 2Q.

662
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:29,190
That's your marginal
revenue function,

663
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,840
if you're the monopolist.

664
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,380
What's your marginal cost?

665
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,930
Well, I just said it's $147.

666
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,550
And then you just solve.

667
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:43,650
And when you solve that, you get
that Q, the optimal quantity,

668
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,620
is 96 flights.

669
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,685
And then how do
you get the price?

670
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:52,560
How do you get the price
of monopoly problem?

671
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,900
How do we know
what the price is?

672
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,615
Yeah?

673
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:57,990
AUDIENCE: Where the quantity
intersects the demand curve.

674
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,120
JONATHAN GRUBER: You've
got to plug it back

675
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,238
into the demand curve.

676
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:02,530
Take that quantity, plug it
back into the demand curve.

677
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:10,860
So the price is 339
minus 96, or 243.

678
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,000
So I just solved the
monopoly problem quickly,

679
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
but that's what we've done
already in this class.

680
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,110
And you could see that
in the graph here.

681
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,840
In figure 13.1, you've
got demand curve,

682
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,160
which is P equals
339 minus Q. You've

683
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,050
got a supply curve, which is
the flat marginal cost of $147.

684
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,030
You develop a marginal
revenue function,

685
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:36,733
which is 339 minus 2Q.

686
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:38,150
As in our previous
example, that's

687
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:41,210
just basically an inward
shift of the demand function.

688
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,090
That intersects marginal
costs at 96 flights.

689
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,250
We have 1,000
passengers per quarter.

690
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,980
It doesn't really matter.

691
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,850
It's just all standardization.

692
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,350
And then to get the price, you
read it off the demand curve.

693
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,120
You say 96 flights means the
price of $243 per flight.

694
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,130
OK, that's what we do if
American was a monopolist.

695
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,580
Now, however, American
is not a monopolist.

696
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,400
American deals with United,
and American doesn't know

697
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,890
what United is going to do.

698
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,750
So what does American do?

699
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:21,630
Well, let's say American
has to deal with the fact--

700
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,850
it now has to recognize
that it's got its own demand

701
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,900
function, qa, which
is the total quantity

702
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,770
in the market minus qu.

703
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,200
So it has a residual
demand function,

704
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,380
which is the total demand in the
market minus what United sells.

705
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,920
So suppose, for example,
American thinks--

706
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,400
American's got a
spy inside United--

707
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,500
and American says,
ha, I think United

708
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,382
is going to fly 64 flights.

709
00:33:53,382 --> 00:33:54,840
So imagine American
thinks United's

710
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,550
going to fly 64 flights.

711
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:05,250
Well, in that case, if they're
going to fly 64 flights,

712
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:12,159
then my demand function is
p sub a equals 339 minus q

713
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:19,320
sub a minus 64, because
the big quantity

714
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,670
is little qa plus little qu.

715
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:30,520
So my demand function is
339 minus q sub a minus 64.

716
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,239
Or in other words, my
residual demand function

717
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:46,090
is that p sub a equals
339 equals 275 minus qa.

718
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,480
So if I think United's
going to fly 64 flights,

719
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,670
then my effective demand
function is 275 minus q.

720
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,260
And then I'm done.

721
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,990
Then I just solve for, what
would I do as a monopolist,

722
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,600
given the other guy's
flying 64 flights?

723
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,560
So you can see that
in figure 13.2.

724
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,260
So I have a demand function.

725
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,050
I say, well, if United's going
to fly 64 flights, that demand

726
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,882
function gets shifted in by 64.

727
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:17,090
And then I'm going to do
the same thing I did before.

728
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,396
I solve for marginal revenue.

729
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:21,490
I'm going to solve
for marginal revenue

730
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,210
and I intersect that
with marginal cost.

731
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:28,480
That's going to happen at 64
flights and a price of $211.

732
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,738
So basically, it's
the same exercise.

733
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:31,530
It's not that hard.

734
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,380
You just first take out
what United is going to do.

735
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,330
The problem is American
doesn't have a spy.

736
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,060
They don't really know
what United's going to do.

737
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,370
They have to essentially
develop a strategy,

738
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:46,060
given the possibilities
of what United might do.

739
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,420
They have to say, look, I
don't know what q sub u is,

740
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,940
so I have to devise my optimal
strategy given q sub u.

741
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,790
In other words, I have
to simultaneously solve

742
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,540
for what I would do at every
possible quantity United

743
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,890
would sell.

744
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,810
I have to solve what I would
do for every possible quantity

745
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,560
United would sell.

746
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,180
And we call this
developing your reaction,

747
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,770
or best response curve.

748
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,840
Your reaction curve or
your best response curve,

749
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,500
which is, what is the
best thing to do, given

750
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,372
what the other guy's doing?

751
00:36:25,372 --> 00:36:26,830
What is the best
thing to do, given

752
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,770
what the other guys doing?

753
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:34,030
You could see that in figure
13.3, we show how that works.

754
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,320
That shows best response curves.

755
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,740
So for example, look at the
intersection on the y-axis,

756
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,160
where the red line
hits the y-axis.

757
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,020
That was our
monopoly equilibrium.

758
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,710
I'm sorry, where the blue
line hits the x-axis, my bad.

759
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,760
We're doing American.

760
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,670
Look at where the blue
line hits the x-axis.

761
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,970
That is assuming
zero United flights.

762
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,650
Where the blue
line is the x-axis

763
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,210
is where there's
zero United flights.

764
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,260
Well, we know what
American would do there.

765
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,720
They would fly 96 flights.

766
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,760
We already solved that.

767
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,370
Now look at the point where
United is flying 64 flights.

768
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:22,752
Well, we also know what
American would do then.

769
00:37:22,752 --> 00:37:24,710
We know that we solved,
in the previous figure,

770
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,130
they would then do 64 flights.

771
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,540
And in general, what that blue
line is is for every quantity

772
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,642
that United flies, what
does American want to fly?

773
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:44,640
So meanwhile, United is
doing the same mathematics.

774
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,250
Imagine, to make life easier--
we'll almost always do this

775
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,360
to make life easy--

776
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,830
imagine United has the same
marginal costs as American,

777
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,440
and obviously faces the
same market demand curve.

778
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,670
Well then, literally, their
math is totally symmetric.

779
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,860
If American wasn't
in the market,

780
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,920
you'd have where the red line
intersects the vertical axis.

781
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,720
If American was
flying zero, United

782
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,390
would flight 96 flights,
because their problem

783
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,140
is identical to American's
monopoly problem.

784
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,920
So the red line is United's
best response curve.

785
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,470
So we've graphed, for
every possible amount

786
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,420
of flights that
United does, what's

787
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,803
American's optimal
amount of flights.

788
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,470
We've solved for every
amount of flights

789
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,140
that American does with
United's also amount of flights.

790
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:34,320
Where those lines intersect
is the Cournot equilibrium.

791
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,820
Why is that the
Cournot equilibrium?

792
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,520
Because at that
point, both firms

793
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,800
are doing the best
they can, given

794
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,790
what the other firm's chosen.

795
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,760
Or in other words,
to say this is

796
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,770
given what the
other firm's doing,

797
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,080
neither firm wants to deviate.

798
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,077
The profit-maximizing choice
is to be where they are, given

799
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:54,160
the other firm's behavior.

800
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,760
So basically, the
Cournot equilibrium

801
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,943
is the only equilibrium that's
possible in this market.

802
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:04,610
And why is that?

803
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,170
So for example, imagine that
American came in and said,

804
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,407
look, I like doing 96 flights.

805
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:11,490
I love being a monopolist.

806
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,800
I'm just going to do 96 flights.

807
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,210
I'm going to do 96 flights,
I'm going to charge $243.

808
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,280
Well, in that case, American--

809
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,800
United, I'm sorry-- would
happily come in at $242

810
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,440
and undercut them and
sell lots of flights,

811
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,330
because that's still
well above marginal cost.

812
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:37,190
So that's not an equilibrium
because United and American are

813
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,690
choosing different outcomes.

814
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,390
It's only equilibrium if
they're both to the point

815
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:45,010
where the same outcome
makes them both happy.

816
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,290
So that's the graphics.

817
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,577
Let's do the math here.

818
00:39:48,577 --> 00:39:49,660
Let's do the Cournot math.

819
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:58,470
In general, the residual
demand for American

820
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:07,020
is that p equals 339
minus qa minus qu.

821
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,760
Remember, big Q is qa plus qu.

822
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:16,590
Since the demand function
is 339 minus big Q,

823
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,296
I simply broke big
Q into qa and qu.

824
00:40:19,296 --> 00:40:22,080
Stop me if this is all unclear.

825
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,620
Simply broke the big Q
into those two components.

826
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,615
So that means that
American's revenue function--

827
00:40:28,615 --> 00:40:32,100
it's called revenue A,
revenue for American--

828
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:40,920
is 339 times qa minus
qa squared minus qaqu.

829
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,965
This is a new term.

830
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:44,340
This was the old
revenue function

831
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,757
we had when they
were monopolists.

832
00:40:45,757 --> 00:40:49,730
Now we've got this new term
that didn't exist before.

833
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,600
So that means the marginal
revenue for American

834
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,980
is now 339 minus 2qa minus qu.

835
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,720
So now their marginal
revenue is actually

836
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,670
a function now of
their own behavior,

837
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,220
but their competitor's behavior.

838
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,090
That's the new margin
revenue function.

839
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,770
But the profit maximization
rule is the same.

840
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,840
We just set that equal
to marginal cost.

841
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,430
We set it equal to
147, and you solve.

842
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:24,180
And what you end up getting
is that q sub a star--

843
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:36,160
the outcome of q sub a is
96 minus 1/2qu star, or qu.

844
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,950
qa star is 96 minus 1/2qu.

845
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,350
If you solve this equation,
that's what you get.

846
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:45,390
That's 1/2, 1/2 qu.

847
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,850
So now we have the
optimal quantity,

848
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,960
but it's a function of
what the other guy does.

849
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,400
That's a problem, except that
we use the same math for United.

850
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,347
Now, if the problem's
symmetric, you

851
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,680
don't have to do the math again.

852
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,930
You know the best response
function will be symmetric,

853
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,620
but that won't
always be the case.

854
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,380
So I'm going to
shortcut here of saying

855
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,250
the best response
function for qu

856
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,920
is q star u equals
96 minus 1/2qa.

857
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,940
So I've just written down
the best response function.

858
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,610
This corresponds to the graph.

859
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:23,360
So q star a, that's
the blue line.

860
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,910
It's 96 minus 1/2u.

861
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,420
q star u, that's the red
line, 96 minus 1/2qa.

862
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,920
That's their best
response function.

863
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,827
Now once again, to remind you, I
could simply skip to this step,

864
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:39,160
but normally you'd have to
solve through for both firms.

865
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,950
They might not have identical
best response functions,

866
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,690
or symmetrical best
response function.

867
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,640
Well now we're golden.

868
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,900
We have two equations
and two unknowns.

869
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,210
We know how to deal with that.

870
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,520
And you solve them
and you get the qa

871
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,820
star equals qu star equals 64.

872
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,150
You solve those two
equations and two unknowns.

873
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:06,300
So 64 is the solution
of that system.

874
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,860
What's the price?

875
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,000
Someone raise their
hand and tell me.

876
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,040
What's the price?

877
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,967
Without looking at the graph.

878
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:15,467
Yeah?

879
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,321
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

880
00:43:16,321 --> 00:43:18,071
JONATHAN GRUBER: And
how did you get that?

881
00:43:18,071 --> 00:43:20,705
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

882
00:43:20,705 --> 00:43:22,580
JONATHAN GRUBER: You
got to plug in 64 twice.

883
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,872
A lot of people get this wrong.

884
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:25,490
They'll say, oh, 339 minus 64.

885
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,360
But no, it's 339 minus 128,
because they're each flying 64

886
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,400
and the price comes from the
total demand in the market.

887
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,733
So the price is $211.

888
00:43:36,733 --> 00:43:38,275
That's an important
mistake to avoid.

889
00:43:38,275 --> 00:43:39,150
A lot of people get here.

890
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:39,970
They'll be super excited.

891
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:40,750
They're tired.

892
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,790
They throw the 64 back
at the demand equation.

893
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,300
But remember, demand's a
function of the total market.

894
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,410
If symmetrically
they're each doing 64,

895
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,950
then the price is
going to be $211.

896
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:53,200
And that is the Nash
or Cournot equilibrium.

897
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,180
Both firms are happy to fly
64 flights at a price of $211.

898
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,970
Neither firm wants to deviate.

899
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:03,430
And you know that because
you've maximized their profits.

900
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,720
When United is flying 64,
the profits of American

901
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,300
are maximized at flying 64.

902
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,640
When American's flying
64, the profits for United

903
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,680
are maximized at flying 64.

904
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,300
Therefore, that is the Nash
or Cournot equilibrium.

905
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,860
Now, when we get to reality,
things might not always

906
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,360
work out so neatly.

907
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,830
Things might not be symmetric.

908
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,380
You might also not
have an equilibrium.

909
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,410
How could you not have
an equilibrium here?

910
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,325
How could that
happen graphically?

911
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:37,200
What would that mean?

912
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,408
Yeah?

913
00:44:40,408 --> 00:44:41,950
AUDIENCE: The curves
don't intersect.

914
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:42,867
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

915
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:45,225
The best response curves
might not intersect.

916
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:46,600
You might not get
an equilibrium.

917
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,225
We don't know what
the hell to do then.

918
00:44:48,225 --> 00:44:50,220
All chaos breaks loose.

919
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,520
But you might not get an
equilibrium in this market

920
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,150
because the best response
curves might not intersect.

921
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,120
In reality, in life, you could
have funky best response curves

922
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,470
that are non-linear or you could
have multiple intersections.

923
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,840
We call it multiple equilibria.

924
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,910
And then it becomes an
indeterminate problem

925
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,680
and you have to figure out which
equilibrium they settle at,

926
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,013
and that involves higher order
mathematics that you talk

927
00:45:12,013 --> 00:45:13,770
about in more advanced classes.

928
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,720
So this is the
simplest, easiest cases.

929
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,960
Symmetric case where linear best
response functions intersect

930
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,460
is your easiest case.

931
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,950
But in general, the
general way to solve this

932
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,670
is the same, which is use
the principle of game theory.

933
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,640
Look, go back to the
prisoner's dilemma.

934
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,580
All we're doing here was
creating best response

935
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,220
functions.

936
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,470
It's just there wasn't a line.

937
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,060
It was just a point.

938
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,387
The best response function
was what we laid out here.

939
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:40,470
All we did with these
United and American examples

940
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,420
was go to a continuum and
develop best response functions

941
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,060
around the best response point.

942
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:46,560
Yeah?

943
00:45:49,758 --> 00:45:51,550
AUDIENCE: If the Nash
equilibrium is always

944
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:54,140
worse than when
they're cooperating,

945
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,560
why is it so hard to
maintain a [INAUDIBLE]??

946
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,750
JONATHAN GRUBER: We'll
talk about that next time.

947
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,510
Other questions?

948
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:02,630
OK, let's stop there.

949
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:02,950
We'll come back.

950
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:05,440
Next time we'll talk about,
why don't we all just get along

951
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,650
with Mr. Rogers once?
