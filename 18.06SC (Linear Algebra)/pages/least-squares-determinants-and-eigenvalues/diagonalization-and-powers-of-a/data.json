  "title":"Diagonalization and Powers of A",
  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview If A has n independent eigenvectors, we can write _A = SΛS_−1, where Λ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of A. This allows us to easily compute powers of A which in turn allows us to solve difference equations uk+1 = Auk. Session Activities Lecture Video and Summary Watch the video lecture Lecture 22: Diagonalization and Powers of A Read the accompanying lecture summary (PDF) Lecture video transcript (PDF) Suggested Reading Read Section 6.2 in the 4th or 5th edition.
