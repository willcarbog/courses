This practice of dissecting a vector into directional components is an important one. In particular, it leads to the \u0026ldquo;least squares\u0026rdquo; method of fitting curves to collections of data. This unit also introduces matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Many calculations become simpler when working with a basis of eigenvectors.\nThe determinant of a matrix is a number characterizing that matrix. This value is useful for determining whether a matrix is singular, computing its inverse, and more.\nLooking for something specific in this course?
