  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview Linear regression is commonly used to fit a line to a collection of data. The method of least squares can be viewed as finding the projection of a vector. Linear algebra provides a powerful and efficient description of linear regression in terms of the matrix ATA.\nSession Activities Lecture Video and Summary Watch the video lecture Lecture 16: Projection Matrices and Least Squares Read the accompanying lecture summary (PDF) Lecture video transcript (PDF) Suggested Reading Read Section 4.3 in the 4th or 5th edition.
