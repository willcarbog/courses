  "title":"Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces",
  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview Vectors are easier to understand when they\u0026rsquo;re described in terms of orthogonal bases. In addition, the Four Fundamental Subspaces are orthogonal to each other in pairs.\nIf A is a rectangular matrix, Ax = b is often unsolvable. The matrix A_T_A will help us find a vector x̂ that comes as close as possible to solving Ax = b.\nSession Activities Lecture Video and Summary Watch the video lecture Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces Read the accompanying lecture summary (PDF) Lecture video transcript (PDF) Suggested Reading Read Section 4.1 in the 4th or 5th edition.
