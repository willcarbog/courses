  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview We can copy Taylor\u0026rsquo;s series for _e_x to define _e_At for a matrix A. If A is diagonalizable, we can use Λ to find the exact value of _e_At. This allows us to solve systems of differential equations du / dt = Au the same way we solved equations like dy / dt = ky.
