  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview The determinant of a matrix is a single number which encodes a lot of information about the matrix. Three simple properties completely describe the determinant. In this lecture we also list seven more properties like detAB = (detA)(detB) that can be derived from the first three.
