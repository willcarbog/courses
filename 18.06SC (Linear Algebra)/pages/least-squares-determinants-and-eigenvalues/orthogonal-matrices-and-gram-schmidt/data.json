  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview Many calculations become simpler when performed using orthonormal vectors or othogonal matrices. In this session, we learn a procedure for converting any basis to an orthonormal one.\nSession Activities Lecture Video and Summary Watch the video lecture Lecture 17: Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt Read the accompanying lecture summary (PDF) Lecture video transcript (PDF) Suggested Reading Read Section 4.4 in the 4th or 5th edition.
