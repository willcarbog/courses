  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview If the product Ax points in the same direction as the vector x, we say that x is an eigenvector of A. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors describe what happens when a matrix is multiplied by a vector. In this session we learn how to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
