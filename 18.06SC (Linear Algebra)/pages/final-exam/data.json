We try to cover all the way from Ax=0 (the null space and the special solutions) to projections, determinants, eigenvalues, and even a touch of singular values from the eigenvalues of ATA. That is the good matrix of linear algebra: square, symmetric, and positive definite or at least semidefinite.\nCheck Yourself Exams and Solutions Exams (PDF) Solutions (PDF) Looking for something specific in this course?
