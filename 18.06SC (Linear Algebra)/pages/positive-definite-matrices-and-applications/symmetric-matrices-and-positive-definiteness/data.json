  "title":"Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness",
  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview Special matrices have special eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Symmetric and positive definite matrices have extremely nice properties, and studying these matrices brings together everything we\u0026rsquo;ve learned about pivots, determinants and eigenvalues. In this session we also practice doing linear algebra with complex numbers and learn how the pivots give information about the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix.\nSession Activities Lecture Video and Summary Watch the video lecture Lecture 25: Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness Read the accompanying lecture summary (PDF) Lecture video transcript (PDF) Suggested Reading Read Section 6.4 through 6.5 in the 4th or 5th edition.
