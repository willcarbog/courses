  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview When we multiply a matrix by an input vector we get an output vector, often in a new space. We can ask what this \u0026ldquo;linear transformation\u0026rdquo; does to all the vectors in a space. In fact, matrices were originally invented for the study of linear transformations.\nSession Activities Lecture Video and Summary Watch the video lecture Lecture 30: Linear Transformations and their Matrices Read the accompanying lecture summary (PDF) Lecture video transcript (PDF) Suggested Reading Read Section 7.1 in the 4th edition or Section 8.1 in the 5th edition.
