  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nPositive definite and semidefinite: graphs of x\u0026rsquo;Ax.\nIn this unit we discuss matrices with special properties – symmetric, possibly complex, and positive definite. The central topic of this unit is converting matrices to nice form (diagonal or nearly-diagonal) through multiplication by other matrices. Generally, this process requires some knowledge of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix.\nLooking for something specific in this course?
