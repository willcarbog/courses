  "title":"Singular Value Decomposition",
  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview If A is symmetric and positive definite, there is an orthogonal matrix Q for which A = Q_Λ_QT. Here Λ is the matrix of eigenvalues. Singular Value Decomposition lets us write any matrix A as a product U_Σ_VT where U and V are orthogonal and Σ is a diagonal matrix whose non-zero entries are square roots of the eigenvalues of ATA. The columns of U and V give bases for the four fundamental subspaces.\nSession Activities Lecture Video and Summary Watch the video lecture Lecture 29: Singular Value Decomposition Read the accompanying lecture summary (PDF) Lecture video transcript (PDF) Suggested Reading Read Section 6.7 in the 4th edition or Section 7.1 and 7.2 in the 5th edition.
