  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview To account for row exchanges in Gaussian elimination, we include a permutation matrix P in the factorization PA = LU. Then we learn about vector spaces and subspaces; these are central to linear algebra.\nSession Activities Lecture Video and Summary Watch the video lecture Transposes, Permutations, Vector Spaces Read the accompanying lecture summary (PDF) Lecture video transcript (PDF) Suggested Reading Read Section 2.7 in the 4th or 5th edition.
