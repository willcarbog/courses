  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview This session introduces the method of elimination, an essential tool for working with matrices. The method follows a simple algorithm. To help make sense of material presented later, we describe this algorithm in terms of matrix multiplication.\nSession Activities Lecture Video and Summary Watch the video lecture Lecture: Elimination with Matrices Read the accompanying lecture summary (PDF) Lecture video transcript (PDF) Suggested Reading Read Section 2.2 through 2.3 in the 4th or 5th edition.
