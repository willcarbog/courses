  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview This session explains inverses, transposes and permutation matrices. We also learn how elimination leads to a useful factorization A = LU and how hard a computer will work to invert a very large matrix.\nSession Activities Lecture Video and Summary Watch the video lecture Factorization into A = LU Read the accompanying lecture summary (PDF) Lecture video transcript (PDF) Suggested Reading Read Section 2.6 in the 4th or 5th edition. Problem Solving Video Watch the recitation video on LU Decomposition Recitation video transcript (PDF) Check Yourself Problems and Solutions Work the problems on your own and check your answers when you\u0026rsquo;re done.\nProblems (PDF) Solutions (PDF) « Previous | Next »\n"}
