00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,560
PROFESSOR: Hi, welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,490
In the lecture, we've learned
very important concepts--

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,620
linear space and
linear subspace.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,200
Well, as you can imagine, if
we call something a space,

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,670
we're putting a lot of things,
a lot of objects into one set.

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,400
But for linear space, we
want to put them in according

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,680
to a particular manner.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,890
So can you recall what are
the conditions for a set

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,280
to be a linear space?

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,490
You take any two elements from
that set, take the sum of them.

11
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,400
You want the sum to be
still in the same set.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,370
That's the first condition.

13
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,010
Second, you take any multiple
of any element from that set,

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,190
the result will
still be in that set.

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,140
That's the second condition.

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,970
And if, within a
linear space, you

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,510
can find a subset which also
satisfies the two conditions,

18
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,560
that will give you a subspace.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,620
Today, we're going to
look at this example

20
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,880
to review these two important
properties of linear space

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,870
and subspace.

22
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,980
I have two vectors, x_1 and x_2.

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,480
Both of them are vectors in R^3.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,910
So, as you can see,
I've drawn them here.

25
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,750
This is x_1, and this is x_2.

26
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,740
So first, we want to find the
subspace generated by x_1.

27
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,820
I call it V_1.

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,430
Let me say a word about
this "generated by."

29
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,190
So what do I mean by a
subspace generated by x_1?

30
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm looking for the smallest
subspace that contains x_1, as

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,470
small as you can get.

32
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,690
Similarly, I want to find out
the subspace generated by x_2,

33
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,520
call it V_2.

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,830
Then we want to say something
about the intersection of V_1

35
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,240
and V_2.

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,080
That's the first question.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,570
And the second question, we
want to put vector x_1 and x_2

38
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,040
together and look at the
subspace generated by x_1

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,890
and x_2 at the same time.

40
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,950
So I call it V_3.

41
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,400
And a good question
to be asked here

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,820
is: what is the relation
of v3 to V_1 union V_2?

43
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,830
Do you think they're equal?

44
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,320
Within the second
question, I would also

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,850
like you to find a subspace,
call it S, of V_3 such

46
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,730
that neither x_1
nor x_2 is in s.

47
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,330
And the last
question is I'd like

48
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,030
you to say something about
the intersection of V_3

49
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,380
with the xy-plane.

50
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,850
So notice that, of course,
xy-plane is also a subspace

51
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,170
of R^3.

52
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,740
So again, I'm looking at the
intersection of two subspaces.

53
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,170
All right, why don't
you hit the pause now,

54
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,860
and try to solve these
three problems on your own.

55
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,040
And I'd like you to identify
your answers in this picture

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,980
whenever you can.

57
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,740
I'll come back later and
continue working with you.

58
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,280
OK, how did your drawing go?

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,350
Let's look at this together.

60
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,660
First, we want to find
subspace generated by x_1.

61
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,520
So here is x_1.

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,100
Let's keep in mind
the two conditions

63
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,710
that a subspace has to satisfy.

64
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,080
Well, if I want to
obtain the subspace,

65
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,210
at least I have to be able
to take any multiple of x_1,

66
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,880
right?

67
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,320
So that means at least I have to
include the straight line that

68
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,000
contains x_1.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,340
So I'm going to try to draw
the straight line here.

70
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,430
So I'm just simply going
to extend this x1 along

71
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,384
to both directions.

72
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:32,520
So x_1, I will try very
hard to make it straight.

73
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,400
But to be honest, it's
really hard for me

74
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,020
to draw straight
lines on the board.

75
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,315
Is that straight?

76
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:41,990
Seems fine.

77
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,690
All right, so this
entire line contains x_1.

78
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,982
So at least this line
has to be in V_1.

79
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:55,000
Is there anything
else beyond this line?

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,920
Now let's turn to
the second condition.

81
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,990
The second condition
says that we

82
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,110
have to be able to take any
two elements, take the sum,

83
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,500
and the sum will
remain in that set.

84
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,440
Does it work for this line?

85
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,030
You take any two
vectors on this line,

86
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,940
or you can say any two
points on this line,

87
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,140
and then you take
to sum of them.

88
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,450
Of course, you still get
something on this line.

89
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,340
You won't be able
to escape from it.

90
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,910
Which means this line
is a perfect set that

91
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,220
satisfies the two conditions.

92
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,880
So this line simply
gives me V_1.

93
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,010
That is the smallest
subspace that contains x_1.

94
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,580
So in other words, the subspace
generated by x_1 is V_1.

95
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,560
So similarly, let's look at x_2.

96
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,700
What is the subspace
generated by x_2?

97
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,030
Again, you get the
entire straight line

98
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,050
that contains x_2.

99
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,445
So I'm going to extend
x_2 in both directions.

100
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,490
I hope it's straight.

101
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,650
Not too bad.

102
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,810
That will give me V_2.

103
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,840
All right, V_1, V_2.

104
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,890
Both of them are
subspaces of R^3.

105
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,630
Now let's look at the
intersection of V_1 and V_2.

106
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,280
So we know that both of
them are straight lines.

107
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,690
And clearly they're
not parallel,

108
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,770
because x_1 and x_2
are not parallel.

109
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,650
So what is the intersection
of V_1 and V_2?

110
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:47,520
The intersection of V_1
and V_2 is the only point

111
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,110
at which they cross.

112
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,490
And where's that point?

113
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,280
It's here, right at the origin.

114
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,420
Because both of them
pass the origin.

115
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,690
I'm going to use O to denote.

116
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,360
That's the intersection
of V_1 and V_2.

117
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,120
This is a set with
only one element.

118
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,250
What can you say about this set?

119
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,330
I claim this is also
a subspace of R^3.

120
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,210
By saying space, we usually
mean a lot of objects together.

121
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,110
But look at this set.

122
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,580
This set fits perfectly
into the conditions

123
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,040
of being a linear space.

124
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,260
You take any multiple of 0,
again you get 0-- 0 plus 0,

125
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,470
you get 0.

126
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,840
So that's a perfectly
fine subspace of R^3.

127
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,340
All right, so what
we have got here is:

128
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,940
I take the intersection
of V_1 and V_2,

129
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,510
and the result, again,
becomes a subspace,

130
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,230
which only contains the origin.

131
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,640
That completes the
first question.

132
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,210
Let's look at the second one.

133
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,980
In the second question, I want
to put x_1 and x_2 together,

134
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,860
and look at the subspace
generated by x_1 and x_2.

135
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,790
And I would also like
you to say something

136
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,140
about the relation
between V_1 union V_2

137
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,210
to the subspace
generated by x_1, x_2.

138
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,980
Let's try to answer the
second question first.

139
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,100
Is there a chance that
V_1 union V_2 equal to v3?

140
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,220
OK, so what is V_1 union V_2?

141
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,700
That's clearly just
two lines, right?

142
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,360
This line union this line.

143
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,710
Is there a chance that this
union will be a subspace?

144
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,830
Let's check the two conditions.

145
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:47,260
First, you take any multiple
of the elements in this union.

146
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,210
It's either on this
line or on this line.

147
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,080
Seems that the multiple is still
going to stay inside the union.

148
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,596
So the first condition
is actually satisfied.

149
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:00,700
What about the second one?

150
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,760
The second one says
that I have to be

151
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,280
able to take any sum, the
sum of any two elements,

152
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,240
from these two lines.

153
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,610
Let's just try a simple
sum, x_1 plus x_2.

154
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,210
So what is x_1 plus x_2?

155
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,710
You just sum up each coordinate.

156
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:26,370
That will give you [2, 5, 3].

157
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,880
In this picture-- can I
draw it in this picture?

158
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:41,045
It's going to be somewhere here.

159
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,824
That's x_1 plus x_3.

160
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:57,560
Did you notice something?

161
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,530
You clearly have got
out of this union.

162
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:11,230
So this sum is not
inside V_1 union V_2.

163
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,730
Which means V_1 union
V-2 is not a subspace.

164
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,830
Then it's impossible that
this union will equal to V_3.

165
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,640
So the answer to
the second question

166
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,020
is no, V_3 is not
equal to V_1 union V_2.

167
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,540
Now let's identify V_3.

168
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,340
Well, as you can see, since we
have seen from this argument

169
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,650
that we have to
be able to include

170
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,490
this diagonal vector here.

171
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,170
But in fact, as you can see
since we can take any elements

172
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,400
from these two
lines, we're actually

173
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:53,680
including every vector on the
plane spanned by V_1 and V_2.

174
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:01,460
So in other words, I'm actually
looking at this huge plane

175
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,690
that is spanned by V_1 and V_2.

176
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,520
That will give me V_3.

177
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,300
So that's reasonable.

178
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,380
I'm looking at the subspace
generated by two lines in R^3.

179
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,780
And that two line will be
able to span a plane in R^3.

180
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,780
Now for the last
part of question two,

181
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,710
I want to find a
subspace S of V_3--

182
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,210
so I want to find a
subspace of this plane--

183
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,460
such that x_1 is not S,
x_2 is not in S either.

184
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,530
So I want to stay away from
this line and this line.

185
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,880
Can you find such
a subspace of V_3?

186
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,470
It's right here.

187
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,280
Because if you look at this
vector, x_1 plus x_2-- sorry,

188
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,300
that should be x_2.

189
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,960
If you look at this
vector, and if you

190
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,520
look at the subspace
generated by this vector,

191
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,990
again you know it's
going to be a line.

192
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,390
And this line is right here.

193
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,840
This line forms a
perfect subspace of V_3.

194
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,960
But neither x_1 nor x_2
is inside this subspace.

195
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,640
So let's just make it S. Of
course, the choice is not

196
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,480
unique.

197
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,280
You can take twice x_1 plus
x_2 or x_1 plus twice x_2.

198
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,350
OK, we have completed
the second problem.

199
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,380
The last problems ask us to
find the intersection of V_3

200
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,430
with xy-plane.

201
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,930
Well, just think about that.

202
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,350
We've identified
V_3 as this plane

203
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,500
spanned by line V_1 and V_2.

204
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,150
And xy is also a plane.

205
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,290
So we're talking about the
intersection of two planes

206
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,830
in R^3.

207
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,660
What would that be?

208
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,590
So you have two
planes intersect.

209
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,120
The intersection will be a
straight line again, right?

210
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,080
So let's locate
that straight line.

211
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,050
We want to find something that
is inside V_3 and xy-plane

212
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,850
at the same time.

213
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,380
What can you say about
the points in xy-plane?

214
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,880
The z-coordinate has to be 0.

215
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,720
And at the same time, we know
that at least x_1 and x_2

216
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,290
are in V_3.

217
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,130
So did you notice that?

218
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,760
x_2 is a vector
that lies in V_3.

219
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,830
But at the same time, the
z-coordinate of x_2 is 0.

220
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,160
That is what we're looking for.

221
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:09,550
So the intersection
of V_3 with xy-plane

222
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:15,090
will simply be the
line that contains x_2.

223
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:20,820
And here we've
identified that as V_2.

224
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,340
That's it.

225
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,610
This is a subspace of R^3.

226
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,580
And this is the subspace of R^3.

227
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,740
The intersection is
again a subspace of R^3.

228
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,590
I hope you've learned a
way to somehow visualize

229
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,380
this linear space and subspace
through this exercise.

230
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,407
Thank you for watching,
and I'll see you next time.
