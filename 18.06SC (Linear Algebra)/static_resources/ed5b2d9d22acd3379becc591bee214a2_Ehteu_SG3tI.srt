MARTINA BALAGOVIC: Hi.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,010
Welcome to recitation.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,590
Today's problem is
about change of basis.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,030
It says the vector
space of polynomials

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:18,725
in x of degree up to 2 has
a basis 1, x, and x squared.

6
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:20,350
That's the obvious
basis that you would

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,260
write for that vector space.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,150
But today we're going to
consider another basis, w_1,

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,910
w_2, and w_3.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,310
And we don't know what w_1,
w_2, and w_3 are explicitly.

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,860
What we know is that
their values at x

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,270
equals minus 1, 0, and 1 are
given by this table here.

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,920
So they are 1, 0, 0;
0, 1, 0; and 0, 0, 1.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,740
We're asked to do the following.

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,800
We're asked to express
this polynomial-- so y

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,160
of x is minus x plus 5-- in
this basis, w_1, w_2, w_3.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,100
We're asked to find
the change of basis

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,180
matrices between these two
bases, 1, x, x squared,

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,850
and w_1, w_2, w_3.

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,440
And finally, we're asked to
find the matrix of taking

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,200
derivatives, which is a
linear map on this space,

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,500
in both of these basis.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,200
And let me give you an extra
level of challenge, which

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,800
is to try to do as much of this
as possible without explicitly

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,910
finding w_1, w_2, and w_3.

26
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,410
I'll let you think
about the problem

27
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,650
and then you can come back
and compare your solution

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,150
with mine.

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,230
Hi.

30
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,370
Welcome back.

31
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,990
So to start with
the problem a, we

32
00:01:40,990 --> 00:02:02,550
need to find coefficients alpha,
beta, and gamma so that y of x

33
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,740
is expressed through,
with this coefficient,

34
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,940
in this new basis,
w_1, w_2, and w_3.

35
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,610
now, one way to do
that would be to look

36
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,230
at this table of
values, explicitly

37
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,320
find w_1, w_2, and w_3, so
a quadratic polynomial is--

38
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,820
all the information
we need about it

39
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,740
is in values at three points.

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:34,110
So say w_1 is a*1 plus b times
x plus c times x squared.

41
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,560
Find a, b, and c.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,230
Find w_1, w_2, w_3 explicitly,
and then go back to this system

43
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,220
and try to find
alpha, beta and gamma.

44
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,420
However, there's a trick.

45
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,480
Let's try to see if we
can do it without finding

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,830
w_1, w_2, and w_3 explicitly.

47
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,010
So let me try to see
what are the values of y

48
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,060
at these points.

49
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,870
So y is minus x plus 5.

50
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,300
So the values are 6, 5, and 4.

51
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,300
And let me, instead of
considering this equation,

52
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:18,840
let me evaluate it at x is
minus 1, x is 0, and x is 1.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:26,660
What I get through this is
that w at minus 1-- actually,

54
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,480
let me write this.

55
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,120
I get w at minus 1,
which is a number,

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,970
equals alpha times
w_1 at minus 1,

57
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,870
which is a number, plus
beta times w_2 at minus 1,

58
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,100
plus gamma times w_3 at minus 1.

59
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:58,110
And similarly at 0,
and similarly at 1.

60
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,090
And now, let me think of
this as a linear system that

61
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,850
has unknowns alpha,
beta, and gamma

62
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,120
coefficients, these values
here at minus 1, 0, and 1.

63
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,840
And the right-hand
side, well, what's

64
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,500
written here on the left-hand
side. y at minus 1, y at 0,

65
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,640
and y at 1.

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,350
If you write this in a matrix
and read off coefficients

67
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,740
from there, you get
the following system.

68
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,380
So this is the matrix of the
system read off from here.

69
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,350
These are the unknowns.

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,699
And these are the values
of the right-hand side.

71
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,990
And I hope you'll agree that
this is a very easy system

72
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,490
to solve.

73
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,900
We just get alpha is 6,
beta is 5, and gamma is 4.

74
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,670
So the solution to the first
part is y equals 6*w_1 plus

75
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:08,420
5*w_2 plus 4*w_3.

76
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,510
And let's notice another thing.

77
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,180
No matter what
values we put here,

78
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,080
this matrix is always
going to stay the same.

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,570
It's only the right-hand
side that's going to change.

80
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,110
So if we're given
any other polynomial

81
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,245
now to express in a
basis w_1, w_2, and w_3,

82
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:26,620
we don't have to
do any thinking.

83
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,410
We don't have to do
any computations.

84
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,890
What we do is go back to
our table at the beginning

85
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,170
and just read off-- let's
go back to the table,

86
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,640
and just read these values.

87
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,940
So in this case, y is 6
times w_1, 5 times w_2,

88
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,960
and 3 times w_3.

89
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,660
And that's already
a hint to solving

90
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,170
the b part, which is
find the change of basis

91
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,930
matrices between 1, x, x
squared and w_1, w_2, w_3.

92
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,060
Change of basis matrices
means expressing

93
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,180
one basis in terms of another.

94
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,620
So as a part of the
problem, we will

95
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,110
have to express 1,
x, and x squared

96
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,930
in terms of w_1, w_2, w_3.

97
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,360
So let's just find their
values at these three points.

98
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,110
One is a constant, it just
takes value 1 everywhere.

99
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,310
x takes value minus 1 at
minus 1, 0 at 0, and 1 at 1.

100
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:26,140
And x squared takes values 1,
0, and 1 at minus 1, 0, and 1.

101
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,630
And from this we can already
conclude the part b here,

102
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:39,206
we can conclude that 1
equals w_1 plus w_2 plus w_3.

103
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:46,680
That x equals
minus w_1 plus w_3.

104
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,800
And that x squared
equals w_1 plus w_3.

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,390
And from this, we
can immediately

106
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,790
write one change
of basis matrix.

107
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:06,520
Namely, since we know
how to express 1, x,

108
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,820
and x squared in terms
of w_1, w_2, and w_3,

109
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,200
we can just copy
this information over

110
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:24,750
to this matrix, getting 1, 1,
1; minus 1, 0, 1; and 1, 0, 1.

111
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,480
So which matrix is this?

112
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,130
This is a matrix--
so we have 1, x,

113
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,030
and x squared expressed in
terms of w_1, w_2, and w_3.

114
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,750
So if we feed this matrix
something expressed

115
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,360
in the basis 1, x, and
x squared, say a, b,

116
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,600
and c, what it's
going to throw out

117
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,460
is the same polynomial expressed
in this basis here, w_1, w_2,

118
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,680
and w_3.

119
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,137
So I'm going to just write that
this is a matrix of this basis

120
00:07:57,137 --> 00:07:57,637
change.

121
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,170
How do we get the other one?

122
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,210
Well, very easy.

123
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,910
We know it's just
the inverse of A.

124
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:18,220
So this is going to
be the matrix that

125
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:24,240
takes something
written in this basis

126
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,050
and transfers it to this basis.

127
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,770
I'm not going to
calculate the inverse

128
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,070
of a matrix in front of you.

129
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,760
Instead I'm going to
consult my oracle.

130
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,900
Sorry about that.

131
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,650
And my oracle says
that the inverse

132
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:52,336
should be 0, 1, 0; minus 1/2,
0, 1/2; and 1/2, minus 1, 1/2.

133
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:53,460
And that solves the b part.

134
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,420
Let's go into the c part.

135
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,170
The c part required us to find
a matrix of taking derivatives,

136
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,030
which is a linear map in
the space of polynomials,

137
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,520
in both of these basis.

138
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,570
So let's first do the
1, x, x squared basis

139
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,860
because that one's easier.

140
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,830
I'm going to call it D_x.

141
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,760
So I'm going to work in
basis 1, x, x squared.

142
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,370
And what I want to express
is the transformation

143
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,400
of taking derivatives.

144
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,250
So here I'm going
to write the vector

145
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,425
to which taking derivatives maps
the polynomial 1, which is 0.

146
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,930
And that's this expressed in
the basis 1, x, x squared.

147
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:48,190
In the second column I'm
going to write x prime,

148
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,240
the vector to which
D_x sends to vector

149
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,120
x, and that's equal to 1,
which expressed in this basis

150
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,070
is 1, 0, 0.

151
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,050
And here I'm going
to write x squared

152
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,700
prime, which is 2x, which,
expressed in this basis,

153
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,750
is just this.

154
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,060
That one was easy.

155
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,270
For the other one,
well we could calculate

156
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,430
w_1, w_2, w_3 explicitly,
take the derivatives,

157
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,180
go back to the table
and repeat the procedure

158
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,050
that we did already.

159
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,769
So expressing these derivatives
in terms of w_1, w_2, w_3,

160
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:28,810
and that's a lot of work.

161
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,020
But we pretty much already
did most of this work.

162
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,230
So we know how to take
derivatives in this basis,

163
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,059
and we know how to go
between these two basis.

164
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:40,350
So if we want to take a
derivative of something written

165
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:48,780
in the basis w_1, w_2,
w_3, well, let's first

166
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,872
write this something in
basis 1, x, x squared.

167
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:55,330
Then let's take a
derivative of it.

168
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,380
And then let's write it
back in the original basis

169
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,050
that we want.

170
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,060
So it's multiplication
of three matrices.

171
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,990
We have all three-- matrix
multiplication is easy.

172
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,350
And my oracle, again, says
that this should be minus 3

173
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:21,470
over 2, 2, minus 1 over 2;
minus 1 over 2, 0, 1 over 2;

174
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:28,080
and 1 over 2, minus 2, 3 over 2.

175
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,681
And that solves the problem.

176
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,930
Now, one thing that I would
want to discuss in the end

177
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,470
is how did you do with
respect to my challenge, which

178
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,580
was let's try to do as
much of it as possible

179
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,650
without finding w_1,
w_2, and w_3 explicitly.

180
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,250
And it seems like
we did really well.

181
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,930
There's nowhere on the
board written w_1 equals,

182
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,100
w_2 equals, w_3 equals.

183
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,780
But is it really so?

184
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,740
It's not.

185
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,550
We calculated the matrix
of A inverse here.

186
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:59,360
And what this really means is
that w_1, w_2, and w_3, written

187
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,760
in the basis 1, x, and x
squared, are as follows.

188
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,640
w_1 is minus 1/2 x
plus 1/2 x squared.

189
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,150
w_2 is 1 minus x squared.

190
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,300
And w_3 is 1/2 x
plus 1/2 x squared.

191
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,270
So you can check your work
with the help of this matrix

192
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,500
in case you did find w_1,
w_2, and w_3 explicitly.

193
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,928
And that's all I
wanted to say today.
