00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,134
PROFESSOR: Hi, and welcome.

2
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:11,550
Today, we're going
to do a problem

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,630
about powers of a matrix.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,270
Our problem is first to find
a formula for the k-th power

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,510
of this matrix C. This is
a two by two matrix that

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,834
depends on variables a and b.

7
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:29,250
And the second
part of our problem

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,210
is to calculate C to the
100th in the special case

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,710
where a and b are -1.

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,840
You can hit pause now,
and I'll give you a minute

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,990
to do the problem yourself.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,210
And then, I'll come back
and we can do it together.

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,720
OK.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,220
We're back.

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,980
Now, what's the first step in
finding powers of a matrix?

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,130
Well, we need to find the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

17
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,900
of this matrix.

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,030
So how do we do that?

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:22,840
We compute the determinant of
C minus lambda I, which is just

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:35,090
the determinant of this matrix:
2b minus a minus lambda,

21
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:47,320
2b minus 2a; a minus b, and
2a minus b minus lambda.

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,780
OK.

23
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,940
If you compute this, well, we
have a lambda squared term.

24
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,760
OK.

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,500
Our lambda term,
if you look at it,

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:06,800
you'll see we get 2b
minus a plus 2a minus b,

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,470
which is just a plus b.

28
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,680
And we have a negative sign.

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,080
And it's negative a
plus b times lambda.

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,930
And our last term is a
little tougher to compute.

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,040
So I'll let you do it yourself.

32
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,390
But you're just going
to get plus a*b.

33
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:32,390
And this will factor as lambda
minus a times lambda minus b.

34
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:38,820
So our eigenvalues
are just a and b.

35
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,370
Now we need to find
our eigenvectors.

36
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,720
So how do we do that?

37
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,170
Well, what we need
to do is we need

38
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,230
to look at C minus a
times the identity.

39
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,770
And we need to find the
null space of this matrix.

40
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,360
So what do we get here?

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,010
We get 2b minus 2a.

42
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:13,080
And then our next entry here,
we get 2a minus b minus a.

43
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,810
So this is a minus b.

44
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,850
Good.

45
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:27,310
So you can see that this
matrix has the same columns

46
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,740
and the same rows.

47
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:37,670
And so you can see that a
vector in the null space,

48
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:43,690
since this column is
-2 times this column,

49
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,370
we can see that our first
eigenvector is just-- or 1, 2,

50
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,050
I should say.

51
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,964
It's just [1, 2].

52
00:03:54,964 --> 00:03:55,464
Good.

53
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,280
Well, I guess we have space
to do the second one too.

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,950
Why not?

55
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,780
So let's write out
the second one also.

56
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,976
Here, we're subtracting
b instead of a.

57
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:14,020
You get b minus a.

58
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,620
You get 2b minus 2a.

59
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,870
We get a minus b.

60
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,430
And what do we have here?

61
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,071
We have 2a minus 2b.

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,000
So now, what's in the
null space of this matrix?

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,780
Well, what you can see
is that this column

64
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,090
is -1 times that column.

65
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:50,910
So our second eigenvector
is just going to be [1, 1].

66
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,020
And I should remind you that
if you have a harder example,

67
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,750
you can just find these
null spaces by elimination

68
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,490
like we always do.

69
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,040
Great.

70
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,610
Now we have our eigenvalues
and our eigenvectors.

71
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,400
So now we can write C
in a nice easy way that

72
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,810
allows us to take powers of it.

73
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,300
So what's that way?

74
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:21,060
So that's C equals
S lambda S inverse.

75
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,910
So this is just, what is S?

76
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,750
Remember, S is our
matrix of eigenvectors.

77
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:36,700
So S is the matrix 1, 2; 1, 1.

78
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,680
Good.

79
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,250
Now what is lambda?

80
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,951
Lambda is the matrix
of eigenvalues.

81
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:41,450
Right?

82
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,360
So it's just a and b.

83
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,330
Those are the diagonal
entries of my lambda matrix.

84
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,110
And then, we just
find S inverse.

85
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,040
So we just take
negative signs here

86
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:05,340
and recall that we have to
divide by the determinant.

87
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,840
And the determinant of
this matrix is just -1.

88
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,080
So we just change
the signs there.

89
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,680
Good.

90
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,310
So this is our nice
decomposition of C.

91
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,740
Now how do we take powers of C?

92
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,820
Well, C to the k is just S
lambda to the k S inverse.

93
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:39,040
[1, 1; 2, 1]; a to the k,
b to the k; [-1, 1; 2, -1].

94
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,020
Good.

95
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:46,820
And multiplying these
matrices together,

96
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,110
just do a little
arithmetic here.

97
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,880
Got a bunch of
powers of a and b.

98
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,040
Because we take powers
of the eigenvalues.

99
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:09,050
We have here, we have 2 b
to the k minus a to the k.

100
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,540
Have a to the k
minus b to the k.

101
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:20,820
2 b to the k minus 2 a to the k.

102
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:27,800
And finally, we get 2 a
to the k minus b to the k.

103
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,540
And this is our
k-th power matrix.

104
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:33,713
Good.

105
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,305
A quick check.

106
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:39,900
It's always good to
check your work here.

107
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,880
Let's plug in k equals 1.

108
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
And what do we get?

109
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:51,080
We get 2b minus a, a minus b,
2b minus 2a, and 2a minus b.

110
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,410
And if we can go all the
way back to our matrix

111
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,160
at the very beginning,
all the way back here,

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,550
that agrees perfectly
with what we started with.

113
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,250
So that's good.

114
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,300
That means that we did
this decomposition right.

115
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,810
Good.

116
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,160
So now, we've computed the
k-th power of this matrix.

117
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,750
Let's do a particular example.

118
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,380
So let's plug in a and b are -1.

119
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,470
So a equals b equals -1.

120
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,690
And k equals 100.

121
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,240
Then what do we get?

122
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,060
Well, -1 to the 100th is just 1.

123
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,830
So we're just plugging in 1
for b to the k and a to the k

124
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,950
everywhere.

125
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:42,049
And we just get, in this
case, C to the 100th is just

126
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,420
[1, 0; 0, 1].

127
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,160
It's just the identity matrix.

128
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,720
Great.

129
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,290
Great.

130
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:52,790
OK.

131
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,800
Now to summarize, how do
we take powers of a matrix?

132
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,940
Well, first we diagonalize.

133
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,980
We write our matrix
as S lambda S inverse.

134
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,358
And then, we just take powers
of the diagonal matrix.
