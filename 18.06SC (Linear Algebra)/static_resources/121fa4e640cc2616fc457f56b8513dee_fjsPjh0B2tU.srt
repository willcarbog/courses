MARTINA BALAGOVIC: Hi.

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,500
Welcome.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,180
Today's problem is
about finding solutions

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,830
of this non-homogeneous linear
system: x minus 2y minus 2z

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,920
equals b_1, 2x minus
5y minus 4z equals b_2,

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,179
and 4x minus 9y
minus 8z equals b_3.

7
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:26,970
And as you can see,
the system doesn't only

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,630
have numbers and
unknowns, it also

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,220
has parameters,
b_1, b_2, and b_3,

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,670
and the solution will
depend on these parameters,

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,390
but also the existence
of the solution

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,090
will depend on these parameters.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,570
And we're asked
to find a solution

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,280
and find when it exists,
depending on the values

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,640
of b_1, b_2, and b_3.

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,130
So now you should pause the
video, solve the problem,

17
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,306
and come back and compare
your solution with mine.

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,420
And we're back.

19
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,310
Let's try it.

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,870
Let's start by solving this
system as though b_1, b_2,

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,900
and b_3 were numbers.

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:13,030
So we write the matrix of the
system, which is 1, minus 2,

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:28,510
minus 2, b_1; and then 2,
minus 5, minus 4, b_2; and 4,

24
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:35,430
minus 9 minus 8, b_3.

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,880
And we do elimination.

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,340
So we multiply the
first row by minus 2

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,500
and add it to the second row.

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,620
And we multiply it by minus 4
and add it to the third row.

29
00:01:51,130 --> 00:02:06,210
And we get 1, minus 2, minus 2,
b_1; 0, 4 minus 5 is minus 1,

30
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,010
4 minus 4 is 0, and minus
2 times b_1 plus b_2.

31
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:26,660
And here we get 0, 8 minus 9
is minus 1, and 8 minus 8 is 0.

32
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,590
Finally, on the right-hand
side, minus 4*b_1 plus b_3.

33
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,310
And you can already
see that something's

34
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,750
going to happen here.

35
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,800
But let's do one more step.

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:53,740
So eliminating further, we get
1, minus 2, minus 2, b_1; 0,

37
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:03,200
minus 1, 0, minus
2*b_1 plus b_2.

38
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,160
And in the last row we replace
it with the last row minus

39
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:18,410
the second row, and we get
0, 0, 0, minus 4*b_1 plus 2--

40
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:30,670
so minus minus 2*b_2 is minus
2*b_1 minus b_2 and plus b_3.

41
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,720
I hope I did this right.

42
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,720
So now let's think of
it as a system again.

43
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,790
The last equation says 0 equals
this expression in b_1, b_2,

44
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,870
and b_3.

45
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,450
So this is something
to note down.

46
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:58,307
If minus 2*b_1 minus b_2 plus
b_3 is some number that's not

47
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:02,400
0, then the last equation is
going to say 0 equals nonzero.

48
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,860
It's never going
to be satisfied,

49
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,630
and the entire system is never
going to have a solution.

50
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:12,030
So in this case, we
have no solutions.

51
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:31,400
If this is equal to 0, so minus
2*b_1 minus b_2 plus b_3 is

52
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,880
equal to 0, then let's do one
more step on this matrix here.

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,570
Let's turn this number into
1 by multiplying this row

54
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,060
by negative 1.

55
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,160
And let's use it to eliminate
this number here as well.

56
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,290
So in this case, we
get-- let me write it

57
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,070
from the last row,
which now becomes 0,

58
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,950
0, 0, equals 0, which is fine.

59
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:07,670
The second row becomes
0, 1, 0, 2*b_1 minus b_2.

60
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,500
And the first one, to
get rid of this minus 2,

61
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,960
we multiply this row by negative
2 and add it to the first one.

62
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:27,580
We get 1, 0, negative 2, and
here we get b_1 plus 4*b_1

63
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,390
which is 5*b_1, minus 2*b_2.

64
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,550
The reason why we did it was to
get the identity matrix here.

65
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,890
And now let's solve this.

66
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,110
These two columns, corresponding
to variables x and y,

67
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,610
have pivots in them.

68
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,985
So these are the
pivot variables.

69
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,100
This column here has no pivot
in it, so it's a free variable.

70
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:06,050
And now we're going to
calculate the solutions,

71
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,720
but by picking
particular values for z,

72
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,180
and then calculating
the values for x and y.

73
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,350
We have two kinds of solution.

74
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,915
One kind is the
particular solution.

75
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:28,390
So this one solves A*x equals b.

76
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,920
There's only one of them.

77
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,250
And we get it by setting the
free variable equal to 0.

78
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,870
Setting the free
variable equal to 0,

79
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:46,540
we get, well this is equal to 0.

80
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,375
The second equation says
y equals this thing here,

81
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:55,870
so 2*b_1 minus b_2.

82
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,500
And the first equation
says x minus 2 times 0

83
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,100
equals this expression here.

84
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,320
So 5*b_1 minus 2*b_2.

85
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,010
That's our particular solution.

86
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,650
The next kind is the
special solution.

87
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:27,470
So remember, those
solve A*x equals 0.

88
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,370
There's as many of them as
there are free variables.

89
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,430
In our case, there's only one.

90
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,430
And we get it by setting all
free variables equal to 0,

91
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,450
except one equal to 1.

92
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,620
And do it for every
free variable.

93
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,900
So in our case there's
only one free variable

94
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,750
and we set z equal to 1.

95
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,680
The solution that
we get in this case,

96
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,280
and remember we're
solving Ax equals

97
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,105
0-- we don't care about the
right-hand side anymore-- so z

98
00:07:58,105 --> 00:07:59,420
is 1.

99
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:06,180
This second equation
says y equals 0,

100
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:12,540
and the first equation says
x minus 2 times 1 equals 0.

101
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,220
In other words, x equals 2.

102
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,200
So the special
solution is [2,  0, 1].

103
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:28,850
And now all solutions
are of the form

104
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:35,970
x equals the particular
solution plus any multiple

105
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,460
of the special solution.

106
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,799
Let me recap.

107
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,929
In case this particular
combination of parameters

108
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:46,150
is not 0, there's no solutions.

109
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,010
In case this particular
combination of parameters

110
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,190
is equal to 0,
there are solutions,

111
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,900
there are as many of them
as there are real numbers c,

112
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,420
and they're all of this
form for these two vectors.

113
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,130
And that's all I
wanted to say today.
