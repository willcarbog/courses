NIKOLA KAMBUROV: Hi everyone.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,750
In this video, we're
going to explore briefly

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,270
the concept of a
vector subspace.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,450
This is the problem
we're going to do.

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:23,040
We're given these four
different subsets of R^3,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,630
and we are asked to figure out
which of these is, in fact,

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,020
a subspace.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:37,110
So I'll give you a few moments
to try to do this on your own,

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,510
and then please come back to
see whether you were right.

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,790
So hi again.

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,330
So before we start,
let's briefly recall

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,500
what a vector subspace is.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,190
Well vector subspace, of
course, it's a subset.

14
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,600
In this case, a subset of R^3.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,349
But it behaves like a
vector space itself,

16
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,590
meaning that if we take
linear combination of elements

17
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:16,920
in the subset, what we get is
still something in that subset.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,170
And in class, Professor
Strang showed you

19
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,080
a few specific
examples of subspaces,

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,010
which are related to matrices.

21
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,090
One of them was the
null space of a matrix,

22
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,980
all the vectors that
the matrix sends to 0,

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,120
and the column space
of a matrix, which

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,300
is the span of the
column of a matrix.

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,390
So let's see if we can
apply what we've learned

26
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,350
in lecture to our problem.

27
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:54,360
Number one: we are given
a linear equation relation

28
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,600
between b_1, b_2, and b_3.

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,886
Once we have something
linear-- this is a philosophy

30
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:04,260
that you'll learn
in this class--

31
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,470
we can always write this
as a matrix equation.

32
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,890
So in particular, b_1 plus
b_2 minus b_3 equals 0,

33
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,210
we can just write
it as the matrix 1,

34
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:25,420
1, negative 1, times
[b 1, b 2,  b 3] equal to 0.

35
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,290
So therefore, b_1,
b_2, and b_3 precisely

36
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,560
describe the null space
of 1, 1 negative 1.

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,120
And thus, what we are
given in the first question

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,750
is a subspace.

39
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,450
What about the second one?

40
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,740
Again, we are given the
relation between b_1, b_2, b_3.

41
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,510
but it's not linear.

42
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,050
b_3 is the product
of b_1 and b_2.

43
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,420
So right, your guts
tell you that this

44
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,635
shouldn't be a vector space.

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,550
But we need to prove why.

46
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:14,200
Well, see that the vector [1, 1,
 1] is inside this subset,

47
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,710
because the third entry is
the product-- 1 is the product

48
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,530
1 and 1.

49
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,020
If the subset were
a subspace itself,

50
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:30,600
then we would have 2,
2, and 2 in it as well.

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,010
Right, because any multiple
of a vector in the subspace

52
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,620
is inside the subspace.

53
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,730
But is [2, 2, 2] described
by this equation?

54
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,720
Well no, because
the third entry, 2,

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,930
is not equal to 2 times 2.

56
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:54,395
So the example in number
2 is not a subspace.

57
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,770
Let's try 3.

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,050
And first-- so we are given--
so the subset in question 3

59
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:14,120
is given as the linear span of
these two vectors, [1, 0, -1]

60
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,920
and [1, 0, 1].

61
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,800
Plus the vector [1, 0, 0].

62
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,160
So let's think about
this geometrically.

63
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,450
We know that the linear span
of two linear independent

64
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,270
vectors-- and these
are obviously linearly

65
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,100
independent-- is a plane in R^3.

66
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,140
So we have the plane,
and we add a vector

67
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,720
to the point on this plane.

68
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,730
So what if the vector
were lying on the plane?

69
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,550
Well we're not going
to change the plane.

70
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,270
We're still going to
remain in the plane.

71
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,320
What I'm hinting at is
the following thing.

72
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,450
That, in fact, [1, 0, 0] is a
linear combination of [1, 0,

73
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,840
-1] and [1, 0, 1], and
it's fairly obvious

74
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,010
to see which linear combination
of these two vectors it is.

75
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:19,625
It's 1/2 [1, 0, -1] plus
1/2 times [1, 0, 1].

76
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,050
So we can write the
whole relation here

77
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,020
in the following way.

78
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:37,230
[b 1, b 2, b 3] is
[1, 0, 0], which

79
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:48,980
we can write this, plus c_1
[1,  0, -1], and c_2 [1 0, 1].

80
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,160
Let me continue this here.

81
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,300
So b_1, b_2, and
b_3 is precisely

82
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:14,840
c_1 plus 1/2 of [1, 0, -1]
plus c_2 plus 1/2 of [1, 0, 1].

83
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,870
So indeed, the points
b_1, b_2, and b_3

84
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:29,280
are described by the linear
span [1, 0, -1] and [1, 0, 1].

85
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,680
So it is a vector
subspace itself.

86
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,585
And finally, let's
look at number 4.

87
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,410
So we have a similar situation.

88
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,190
I mean, it's almost
the same situation.

89
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,520
We again have the linear span
of precisely the same vectors

90
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,610
as in question 3.

91
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,260
But this time we add the
vector [0, 1, 0] to them.

92
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,880
Now, [0, 1, 0] is not in the
span of these two vectors.

93
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,270
So the argument that we just
showed for 3 doesn't work.

94
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,310
But what we know
about vector subspaces

95
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,820
is the following thing.

96
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,190
I follows almost
trivially from the axioms

97
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,550
that 0 needs to be inside
the subset in order

98
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,450
for it to be a subspace.

99
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,060
It's a necessary condition.

100
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,720
Well is 0 inside this subset?

101
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:55,250
Meaning can we find coefficients
c_1 and c_2, plus [0, 1, 0]

102
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,300
to equal zero vector?

103
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,430
And the answer is no.

104
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,960
And why is this?

105
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,230
There's a very
easy way to see it.

106
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:13,460
Well we just look at the
second entry of the vectors,

107
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,360
and we see that any multiple--
so the linear span of these two

108
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,220
vectors will have as
its second entry 0.

109
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,270
And when we add it to 1, we can
never get a zero entry here.

110
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,870
So the subset in 4
is not a subspace.

111
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,230
So I hope this was useful in
just getting an intuition which

112
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,380
subsets of R^3 are subspaces.

113
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,550
I'll see you guys later.
