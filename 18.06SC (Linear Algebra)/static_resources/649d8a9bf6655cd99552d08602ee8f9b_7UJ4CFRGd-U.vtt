00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.020
SARAH HANSEN: Well, you have a
lot of followers of your 18.06

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.520
videos.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.440
GILBERT STRANG:
That's wonderful.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.350
SARAH HANSEN: And I'll
read this quote to you.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.260
"A commenter even noted
that this is not lecture,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.850
this is art."

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.780
GILBERT STRANG: Gosh.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.860
OK.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.120
Well, if you're going to ask
what's my system, I have none.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540
I guess-- well, first
I like students.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.240
And I want to help.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:42.930
And maybe the key point
is to think with them.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.480
Not to just say, OK, here
it is, listen, listen up.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.490
I think through the question
all over again as they do.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.820
And you have to give time.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.170
You can't zip through a proof.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.620
Because this class has to be
sort of thinking with you.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.040
And that's-- yeah,
that's my thought.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.820
I don't know if I achieve it,
but I think it's the goal.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.110
SARAH HANSEN: One
of our users on OCW

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.970
noted that during
lectures you sometimes ask

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.877
rhetorical questions, or maybe
feign confusion as a way--

00:01:28.877 --> 00:01:30.210
GILBERT STRANG: Feign confusion?

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.080
I'm confused.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.371
SARAH HANSEN: Are you?

00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:31.470
OK.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.580
GILBERT STRANG: Well, no.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.060
Well, no, it's probably true.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.160
That's maybe part of
not rushing through it.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:49.500
But getting-- so I'll pause
at the critical point, maybe.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.500
You have to give time to see,
OK, what's the next step?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.170
You know, mathematics
is beautifully ordered,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.180
and sensible, and logical.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.750
And linear algebra
is not too difficult.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.690
But still, you can't rush.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.660
You have to sort of see
the idea a few times.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.240
First maybe on the
board as symbols.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.000
But not everybody
picks up on symbols.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.770
Then you say, what does it mean?

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.580
And then finally you
say, why is it true?

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.560
But you don't say,
"Why is it true?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.670
Give the proof,"
the very first step.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.620
You want to make people
think, yeah, it is true.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.260
SARAH HANSEN: Others have noted
that you do this thing where

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.620
you display your own
thinking kind of on the spot

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.290
as you work through problems.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.440
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.810
SARAH HANSEN: Is there ever
a risk in that for you?

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.040
GILBERT STRANG: Oh, yes.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.750
And it happens, that
I lose the thread

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.620
or I come up to a dead
end where I don't know

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.950
what I'm supposed to do next.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.170
But generally, especially in
18.06, The basic linear algebra

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.180
course that many
people have watched,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.950
there I kind of get it OK.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.490
Yeah, I've taught
it enough times

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.120
to have a good chance
of getting it right.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.630
SARAH HANSEN: Is this a strategy
that you developed over time?

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.270
You know, lots of people
are nervous to do that,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.900
to make themselves vulnerable
in front of a large lecture

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.680
class like that.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.290
But you're working
problems in real time

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.848
and demonstrating what happens
when you hit a dead end.

00:03:38.848 --> 00:03:40.890
GILBERT STRANG: Well,
that's OK, because students

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.300
are going to hit dead ends, so
it seems to me it's OK for me

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.310
to get stuck, too.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.150
And then if they see,
oh, OK, maybe this

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.600
is the way to get
out of that corner.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.910
Yeah.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.080
So essentially I think the
thing is I like students.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.610
I like math.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.020
And putting them together is
just the best job in the world.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.818
SARAH HANSEN: Let's talk
about humor for a second.

00:04:09.818 --> 00:04:10.610
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.985
SARAH HANSEN: You
have been known

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:15.172
to say things like, keep things
in their Gauss-given order.

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:16.089
GILBERT STRANG: I see.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.381
SARAH HANSEN: And other really
funny things that people

00:04:18.381 --> 00:04:19.730
just love.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.000
So what's the role of
humor in your teaching?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.830
GILBERT STRANG:
Well, maybe it's--

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.630
which is what I'm saying
here, maybe the key point

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.160
is to make it human.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.080
You know, you're a person,
like the student is a person.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.890
The book isn't quite a person,
but it was written by a person.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:47.120
And to see that it's just
like a natural thing to do.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.660
Yeah.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.380
Yeah.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.010
Yeah.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.990
SARAH HANSEN: So
one of our users

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.260
was thinking about how you
teach complex material, how

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.430
you convey it in ways that
are comfortable for students.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.380
And the user was
wondering, how do

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.330
you know when to go into
detail and when not to?

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.000
GILBERT STRANG: I suppose I try
to think it through once again.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.460
And then you sort
of automatically

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.370
see the word-- you recognize
what words you need to use,

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.990
and what the steps are.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.570
Yeah.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.560
If you're not
thinking it yourself,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.950
then you're probably
going too fast

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:35.290
and not connecting with
the thinking of the class.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.790
SARAH HANSEN: And
how do you connect

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.230
with the thinking of the class
when it's such a large lecture

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.730
hall?

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.000
And everyone's at a different
point in their understanding.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.930
GILBERT STRANG:
That's probably true.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.910
And of course, you don't
know what everybody

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.980
is thinking in that class.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:54.540
But overall, if you get--

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.720
if you stay sort of conscious
of the class, conscious of where

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.620
they are, that's, I think,
the thing for any speaker,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.120
is to be conscious
of the audience

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.210
and not just a A-B inverse.

00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:15.520
SARAH HANSEN: What
else would you

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.330
like to add about teaching
18.06 linear algebra?

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.130
GILBERT STRANG: Well, with
18.06 of course, I'm just--

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.770
so, recently, Open
CourseWare, which I think

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.930
was just such a great idea.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.400
Great idea for MIT.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.220
Great idea for faculty.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.400
So they did a count of the
number of viewers in 18.06,

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.600
and it was 10 million.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.240
Which was like, woo.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.880
I never expected.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.270
But I do get nice,
really nice messages

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.940
from all over the world.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.300
And I reply to
them far as I can.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.430
Sometimes they'll ask what's
a good way to learn math?

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.770
I don't know if I have
an answer to that.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.650
But anyway, I try
to be encouraging.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.210
So yeah.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.740
It's been wonderful.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:23.035
Just having the video
lectures available

00:07:23.035 --> 00:07:26.500
allows everybody
to be in the class.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.700
Yeah.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.270
So, thank you all for
joining the class.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.090
Thank you.
