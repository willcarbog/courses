DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,060
I'm Dave.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,840
Now today, I'd like to
tackle a problem

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,990
in orthogonal subspaces.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,260
So the problem we'd like to
tackle, given a subspace S,

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,400
and suppose S is spanned by two
vectors, 1, 2, 2, 3, and

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,530
1, 3, 3, 2.

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,920
We have a question here
which is to find

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,630
a basis for S perp--

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,540
S perp is another subspace which
is orthogonal to S. And

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,870
then secondly, can every vector
in R4 be uniquely

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,260
written in terms of
S and S perp.

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,800
So I'll let you think about this
for now, and I'll come

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,050
back in a minute.

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:53,419

17
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:54,620
Hi everyone.

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,060
Welcome back.

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,180
OK, so why don't we tackle
this problem?

20
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,880

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,650
OK, so first off, what
does it mean for a

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,760
vector to be an S perp?

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:18,470
Well if I have a vector x, and
S perp, and x is in S perp,

24
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,530
what this means is x is going
to be orthogonal to every

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,870
vector in S. Now specifically,
S is spanned

26
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,640
by these two vectors.

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,660
So it's sufficient that x be
perpendicular to the two bases

28
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,250
vectors in S.

29
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:45,720
So specifically, I can take 1,
2, 2, 3, and dot it with x,

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,230
and it's going to be 0.

31
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,210
So I'm treating x as a
column vector here.

32
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:59,340
In addition, x must also be
orthogonal to 1, 3, 2, 2.

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,600

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,570
So any vector x that's an S
perp must be orthogonal to

35
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,750
both of these vectors.

36
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,280
So what we can do
is we can write

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,680
this as a matrix equation.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,140

39
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,290
And we do this by combining
these two vectors as rows of

40
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,540
the matrix.

41
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:31,470

42
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,070
So if we step back and take a
look at this equation, we see

43
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,700
that what we're really asking
is to find all x that are in

44
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,410
the null space of this matrix.

45
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,990
So how do we find x in the
null space of a matrix?

46
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,740
Well what we can do is we can
row reduce this matrix and try

47
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,270
and find a basis for
the null space.

48
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,140
So I'm going to just row reduce
this matrix, and notice

49
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,380
that by row reduction, we don't
actually change the null

50
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,850
space of a matrix.

51
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,390
So if I'm only interested in the
null space, this system is

52
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,530
going to be equivalent to, I can
keep the top row the same.

53
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,030

54
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,560
And then just to simplify our
lives, we can take the second

55
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,680
row and subtract one copy
of the first row.

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,590

57
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,080
Now, if I do that, I
obtain 0, 1, 1, -1.

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,450

59
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,310
Now, to parameterize the null
space, what I'm going to do is

60
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,640
I'm going to write x
out as components.

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:48,550
So if I write x with components
x1, x2, x3 and x4,

62
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,790
we see here that this matrix
has a rank of 2.

63
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,570
Now, we're looking at vectors
which live in R4, so we know

64
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,610
that the null space is going
to have a dimension

65
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,620
which is 4 minus 2.

66
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,820
So that means there should be
two vectors in the null space

67
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,610
of this matrix.

68
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,440
To parameterize these two
dimensional vectors, what I'm

69
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,040
going to do is I'm going to let
x4 equals some constant,

70
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,250
and x3 equal another constant.

71
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,530
So specifically, I'm going
to let x4 equal b,

72
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,838
and x3 equal a.

73
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:29,190

74
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,160
Now what we do is we take a look
at these two equations,

75
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,770
and this bottom equation will
say that x2 is equal to

76
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:51,230
negative x3 plus x4, which is
going to equal -a, x4 plus b.

77
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,090

78
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:01,500
And then the top equation says
that x1 is equal to -2, x2

79
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:16,680
minus 2x3 minus 3x4, And
if I substitute in,

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,252
x2 is -a plus b.

81
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:22,500

82
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,608
x3 is a.

83
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:26,858
And x4 is b.

84
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:30,020

85
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,380
So when the dust settles,
the a's cancel and

86
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,930
I'm left with -5b.

87
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,030

88
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,430
So we can combine everything
together and we end up

89
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:56,290
obtaining x1, x2, x3,
x4 equals -5b.

90
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,566
x2 is -a plus b.

91
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:03,692

92
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:10,130
x3 is a, and x4 is b.

93
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,980
And now what we can do is we
can take this vector and we

94
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,840
can decompose it into pieces
which are a multiplied by a

95
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,630
vector, and b multiplied
by a vector.

96
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:29,610
So you'll note that this is
actually a times 0, -1, 1, 0

97
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:40,110
plus b times -5, 1, 0, 1.

98
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,100
OK?

99
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,390
So we have successfully achieved
a parameterization of

100
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,600
the null space of this matrix
as some constant a times a

101
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,700
vector 0, -1, 1, 0 plus b times
a vector -5, 1, 0, 1.

102
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,170
And now we claim that this is
the entire space, S perp.

103
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,190

104
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,740
So S perp is going to be spanned
by this vector and

105
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,060
this vector.

106
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,870
Now notice how if I were to
take either of these two

107
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,230
vectors in S and dot it with any
vector in the null space,

108
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,425
by construction it automatically
vanishes.

109
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:25,190

110
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,190
So this concludes part one.

111
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,330
Now for part two.

112
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,510
Can every vector v in R4 be
written uniquely in terms of S

113
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,020
and S perp?

114
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,270
The answer is yes.

115
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:42,440

116
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,460
So how do we see this?

117
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,300
Well if I have a vector v, what
I can do is I can try and

118
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:58,080
write it as some constant c1
times the vector 1, 2, 2, 3

119
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:15,700
plus c2 times the vector 1, 3,
3, 2 plus the vector c3, 0,

120
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:25,810
-1, 1, 0 plus c4, -5, 1, 0, 1.

121
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,870
OK?

122
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,190
So c1 and c2 are multiplying the
vectors in S, and c3 and

123
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,450
c4 are multiplying the
vectors in S perp.

124
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,760
So the question is, given any
v, can I find constants c1,

125
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,370
c2, c3, c4, such that
this equation holds?

126
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,620
And the answer is yes.

127
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,680

128
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,950
Just to see why it's yes, what
we can do is we can rewrite

129
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,175
this in matrix notation, and
there's kind of a handy trick.

130
00:08:56,175 --> 00:09:13,860

131
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,410
What I can do is I can take
these columns and write them

132
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,660
as columns of the matrix.

133
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,640

134
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,560
And this whole expression is
actually equivalent to this

135
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,100
matrix multiplied by the
constant, c1, c2, c3, c4.

136
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,760
And on the right-hand side,
we have the vector v.

137
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,510
Now, by construction, these
vectors are linearly

138
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,540
independent.

139
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,520
And we know from linear algebra
that if we have a

140
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,990
matrix with linearly independent
columns, the

141
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,280
matrix is invertible.

142
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,650
What this means is for any v on
the right-hand side, we can

143
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,080
invert this matrix
and obtain unique

144
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,590
coefficients, c1, c2, c3, c4.

145
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,220
This then gives us a unique
decomposition for v in terms

146
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,690
of a piece which is in S, and
the piece which is in S perp.

147
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,880

148
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,630
And in general this can be done
for any vector space.

149
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,060
Well I'd like to conclude this
problem now and I hope you had

150
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,310
a good time.

151
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,860
