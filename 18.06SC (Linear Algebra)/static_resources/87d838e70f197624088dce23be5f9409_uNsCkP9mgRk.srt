1
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,040
OK, here's the last lecture in
the chapter on orthogonality.

2
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,409
So we met orthogonal
vectors, two vectors,

3
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:38,030
we met orthogonal subspaces,
like the row space and null

4
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,090
space.

5
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,220
Now today we meet
an orthogonal basis,

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,870
and an orthogonal matrix.

7
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,420
So we really --

8
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,670
this chapter cleans
up orthogonality.

9
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,430
And really I want --

10
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,380
I should use the
word orthonormal.

11
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:07,190
Orthogonal is -- so my
vectors are q1,q2 up to qn --

12
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,680
I use the letter "q",
here, to remind me,

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,770
I'm talking about orthogonal
things, not just any vectors,

14
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,190
but orthogonal ones.

15
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,730
So what does that mean?

16
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,100
That means that every q is
orthogonal to every other q.

17
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,380
It's a natural idea,
to have a basis that's

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,560
headed off at
ninety-degree angles,

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,620
the inner products are all zero.

20
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,760
Of course if q is -- certainly
qi is not orthogonal to itself.

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,700
But there we'll make
the best choice again,

22
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,550
make it a unit vector.

23
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,110
Then qi transpose qi is
one, for a unit vector.

24
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,090
The length squared is one.

25
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,930
And that's what I would
use the word normal.

26
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:03,980
So for this part, normalized,
unit length for this part.

27
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,480
OK.

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,620
So first part of
the lecture is how

29
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,820
does having an orthonormal
basis make things nice?

30
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,830
It certainly does.

31
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,990
It makes all the
calculations better,

32
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,650
a whole lot of
numerical linear algebra

33
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,020
is built around working
with orthonormal vectors,

34
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,730
because they never
get out of hand,

35
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,720
they never overflow
or underflow.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,890
And I'll put them
into a matrix Q,

37
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,930
and then the second
part of the lecture

38
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,130
will be suppose my
basis, my columns of A

39
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,210
are not orthonormal.

40
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,160
How do I make them so?

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,610
And the two names associated
with that simple idea

42
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,340
are Graham and Schmidt.

43
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:58,910
So the first part is we've
got a basis like this.

44
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,540
Let's put those into
the columns of a matrix.

45
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,490
So a matrix Q that has --

46
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,180
I'll put these
orthonormal vectors,

47
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,150
q1 will be the first column,
qn will be the n-th column.

48
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,110
And I want to say, I want
to write this property,

49
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,390
qi transpose qj
being zero, I want

50
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,140
to put that in a matrix form.

51
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,890
And just the right thing is
to look at Q transpose Q.

52
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,020
So this chapter has been
looking at A transpose A.

53
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,970
So it's natural to
look at Q transpose Q.

54
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,990
And the beauty is it
comes out perfectly.

55
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,660
Because Q transpose has
these vectors in its rows,

56
00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:01,010
the first row is q1 transpose,
the nth row is qn transpose.

57
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,570
So that's Q transpose.

58
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,110
And now I want to multiply by Q.

59
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,310
That has q1 along to
qn in the columns.

60
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,930
That's Q.

61
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,910
And what do I get?

62
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,740
You really -- this is the
first simplest most basic fact,

63
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,430
that how do orthonormal
vectors, orthonormal columns

64
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,160
in a matrix, what happens
if I compute Q transpose Q?

65
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,350
Do you see it?

66
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,560
If I take the first row
times the first column,

67
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,670
what do I get?

68
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,180
A one.

69
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,070
If I take the first row
times the second column,

70
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,830
what do I get?

71
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,780
Zero.

72
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,670
That's the orthogonality.

73
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,960
The first row times the
last column is zero.

74
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,130
And so I'm getting
ones on the diagonal

75
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,120
and I'm getting zeroes
everywhere else.

76
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,580
I'm getting the identity matrix.

77
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,420
You see how that's -- it's
just like the right calculation

78
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,240
to do.

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,040
If you have orthonormal
columns, and the matrix

80
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,920
doesn't have to be square here.

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,790
We might have just two columns.

82
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,170
And they might have
four, lots of components.

83
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:28,870
So but they're orthonormal, and
when we do Q transpose times Q,

84
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,610
that Q transpose times
Q or A transpose A

85
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,180
just asks for all
those dot products.

86
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,030
Rows times columns.

87
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,890
And in this orthonormal case,
we get the best possible answer,

88
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,350
the identity.

89
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,830
OK, so this is --

90
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:55,190
so I mean now we have a new
bunch of important matrices.

91
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,570
What have we seen previously?

92
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,940
We've seen in the
distant past we

93
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,680
had triangular matrices,
diagonal matrices, permutation

94
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,260
matrices, that was
early chapters,

95
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:14,690
then we had row echelon
forms, then in this chapter

96
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,400
we've already seen
projection matrices,

97
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,330
and now we're seeing this
new class of matrices

98
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,990
with orthonormal columns.

99
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,010
That's a very long expression.

100
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:34,520
I sorry that I can't just
call them orthogonal matrices.

101
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,590
But that word
orthogonal matrices --

102
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,940
or maybe I should be able to
call it orthonormal matrices,

103
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,590
why don't we call
it orthonormal --

104
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,790
I mean that would be an
absolutely perfect name.

105
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,360
For Q, call it an
orthonormal matrix

106
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,870
because its columns
are orthonormal.

107
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:57,770
OK, but the convention is
that we only use that name

108
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,430
orthogonal matrix,
we only use this --

109
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,170
this word orthogonal,
we don't even

110
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,450
say orthonormal for
some unknown reason,

111
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,035
matrix when it's square.

112
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:20,240
So in the case when this is a
square matrix, that's the case

113
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,330
we call it an orthogonal matrix.

114
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,790
And what's special about
the case when it's square?

115
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:34,890
When it's a square matrix,
we've got its inverse, so --

116
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:49,350
so in the case if Q is square,
then Q transpose Q equals I

117
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,230
tells us --

118
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,320
let me write that underneath --

119
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:03,170
tells us that Q
transpose is Q inverse.

120
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,500
There we have the
easy to remember

121
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,940
property for a square matrix
with orthonormal columns.

122
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,460
That -- I need to write
some examples down.

123
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,680
Let's see.

124
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,250
Some examples like if I
take any -- so examples,

125
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,220
let's do some examples.

126
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,330
Any permutation matrix,
let me take just

127
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,860
some random permutation matrix.

128
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:39,419
Permutation Q equals let's say
oh, make it three by three,

129
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:45,550
say zero, zero, one, one,
zero, zero, zero, one, zero.

130
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,050
OK.

131
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,360
That certainly has unit
vectors in its columns.

132
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,440
Those vectors are certainly
perpendicular to each other.

133
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,200
And if I -- and so that's it.

134
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,940
That makes it a Q.

135
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,860
And -- if I took its transpose,
if I multiplied by Q transpose,

136
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,140
shall I do that -- and let
me stick in Q transpose

137
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,900
here.

138
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,490
Just to do that
multiplication once more,

139
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,700
transpose it'll put the --

140
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,220
make that into a column,
make that into a column,

141
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,420
make that into a column.

142
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,700
And the transpose is also --

143
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,190
another Q.

144
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,570
Another orthonormal matrix.

145
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,610
And when I multiply that
product I get I. OK,

146
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,390
so there's an example.

147
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,360
And actually there's
a second example.

148
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,920
But those are real
easy examples, right,

149
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,280
I mean to get orthogonal
columns by just

150
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,130
putting ones in different
places is like too easy.

151
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,530
So let me keep
going with examples.

152
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,670
So here's another
simple example.

153
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,670
Cos theta sine theta,
there's a unit vector,

154
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,420
oh, let me even
take it, well, yeah.

155
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,000
Cos theta sine theta
and now the other way

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,290
I want sine theta cos theta.

157
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,200
But I want the inner
product to be zero.

158
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,650
And if I put a minus
there, it'll do it.

159
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,260
So that's -- unit vector,
that's a unit vector.

160
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,420
And if I take the dot product,
I get minus plus zero.

161
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,470
OK.

162
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:42,730
For example Q equals say
one, one, one, minus one,

163
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,210
is that an orthogonal matrix?

164
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,100
I've got orthogonal
columns there,

165
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,420
but it's not quite
an orthogonal matrix.

166
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,500
How shall I fix it to
be an orthogonal matrix?

167
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,280
Well, what's the length
of those column vectors,

168
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,040
the dot product with themselves
is -- right now it's two,

169
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,260
right, the --

170
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,540
the length squared.

171
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,216
The length squared would be
one plus one would be two,

172
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:14,840
the length would be
square root of two,

173
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,290
so I better divide by
square root of two.

174
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,250
OK.

175
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,580
So there's a -- there now I
have got an orthogonal matrix,

176
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,850
in fact, it's this one --
when theta is pi over four.

177
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,710
The cosines and
well almost, I guess

178
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,110
the minus sine is down
there, so maybe, I

179
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,151
don't know, maybe minus
pi over four or something.

180
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:39,650
OK.

181
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
Let me do one
final example, just

182
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,500
to show that you
can get bigger ones.

183
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,770
Q equals let me take that
matrix up in the corner

184
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,330
and I'll sort of
repeat that pattern,

185
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:02,510
repeat it again, and
then minus it down here.

186
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:13,300
That's one of the world's
favorite orthogonal matrices.

187
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,590
I hope I got it right, is --

188
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,000
can you see whether --

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,390
if I take the inner product of
one column with another one,

190
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,490
let's see, if I take
the inner product

191
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,570
of that column with that I have
two minuses and two pluses,

192
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,460
that's good.

193
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,780
When I take the inner
product of that with that

194
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,891
I have a plus and a
minus, a minus and a plus.

195
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:33,390
Good.

196
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,030
I think it all works out.

197
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,710
And what do I have
to divide by now?

198
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,005
To make those into unit vectors.

199
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:50,020
Right now the vector one,
one, one, one has length two.

200
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,160
Square root of four.

201
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,180
So I have to divide by two
to make it unit vector,

202
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,690
so there's another.

203
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,050
That's my entire array
of simple examples.

204
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:12,110
This construction is named after
a guy called Adhemar and we

205
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:18,460
know how to do it for
two, four, sixteen,

206
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:26,170
sixty-four and so on, but we --
nobody knows exactly which size

207
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,470
matrices have --

208
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:33,750
which size -- which sizes allow
orthogonal matrices of ones

209
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,800
and minus ones.

210
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,950
So Adhemar matrix is an
orthogonal matrix that's got

211
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:45,570
ones and minus ones, and a
lot of ones -- some we know,

212
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,630
some other sizes, there couldn't
be a five by five I think.

213
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,470
But there are some
sizes that nobody

214
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:57,720
yet knows whether there could be
or can't be a matrix like that.

215
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,660
OK.

216
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,360
You see those
orthogonal matrices.

217
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,410
Now let me ask what -- why
is it good to have orthogonal

218
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,550
matrices?

219
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,330
What calculation is made easy?

220
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,540
If I have an orthogonal matrix.

221
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,160
And -- let me remember that the
matrix could be rectangular.

222
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,380
Shall I put down --

223
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,180
I better put a
rectangular example down.

224
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,770
So the -- these were
all square examples.

225
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,410
Can I put down just --

226
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,690
a rectangular one
just to be sure

227
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,580
that we realize that
this is possible.

228
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,430
let's help me out.

229
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:49,370
Let's see, if I put like a
one, two, two and a minus two,

230
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,135
minus one, two.

231
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,840
That's -- a matrix -- oh its
columns aren't normalized yet.

232
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,450
I always have to
remember to do that.

233
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,090
I always do that last
because it's easy to do.

234
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,960
What's the length
of those columns?

235
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,920
So if I wanted them -- if I
wanted them to be length one,

236
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,340
I should divide by their
length, which is --

237
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,940
so I'd look at one squared plus
two squared plus two squared,

238
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,920
that's one and four
and four is nine,

239
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,920
so I take the square root and
I need to divide by three.

240
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,420
OK.

241
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,280
So there is --

242
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:36,820
well, without that, I've
got one orthonormal vector.

243
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,560
I mean just one unit vector.

244
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,630
Now put that guy in.

245
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,730
Now I have a basis
for the column

246
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,480
space for a two-dimensional
space, an orthonormal basis,

247
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,000
right?

248
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,640
These two columns
are orthonormal,

249
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,160
they would be an
orthonormal basis

250
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,690
for this two-dimensional
space that they span.

251
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,200
Orthonormal vectors by the way
have got to be independent.

252
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,410
It's easy to show that
orthonormal vectors

253
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,140
since they're headed off
all at ninety degrees

254
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,130
there's no combination
that gives zero.

255
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:22,470
Now if I wanted to
create now a third one,

256
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:28,720
I could either just put in
some third vector that was

257
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,300
independent and go to this
Graham-Schmidt calculation that

258
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,360
I'm going to explain, or I
could be inspired and say look,

259
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,490
that -- with that pattern,
why not put a one in there,

260
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,150
and a two in there,
and a two in there,

261
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,760
and try to fix up the
signs so that they worked.

262
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,570
Hmm.

263
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,750
I don't know if I've done
this too brilliantly.

264
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,730
Let's see, what
signs, that's minus,

265
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:04,770
maybe I'd make a minus sign
there, how would that be?

266
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,490
Yeah, maybe that works.

267
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:15,670
I think that those three columns
are orthonormal and they --

268
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,220
the beauty of this -- this is
the last example I'll probably

269
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,599
find where there's no
square root, the --

270
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,750
the punishing thing
in Graham-Schmidt,

271
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,220
maybe we better know
that in advance,

272
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,450
is that because I want these
vectors to be unit vectors,

273
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,400
I'm always running
into square roots.

274
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,770
I'm always dividing by lengths.

275
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,610
And those lengths
are square roots.

276
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,400
So you'll see as soon as I
do a Graham-Schmidt example,

277
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,690
square roots are
going to show up.

278
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,460
But here are some
examples where we did it

279
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,350
without any square root.

280
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,160
OK.

281
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,400
OK.

282
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,610
So -- so great.

283
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:06,260
Now next question is what's
the good of having a Q?

284
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,360
What formulas become easier?

285
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,040
Suppose I want to
project, so suppose Q --

286
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,510
suppose Q has
orthonormal columns.

287
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,650
I'm using the letter
Q to mean this,

288
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,630
I'll write it this
one more time,

289
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,620
but I always mean
when I write a Q,

290
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,410
I always mean that it
has orthonormal columns.

291
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:41,415
So suppose I want to project
onto its column space.

292
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,670
So what's the projection matrix?

293
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,260
What's the projection matrix is
I project onto a column space?

294
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,810
OK, that gives me a chance to
review the projection section,

295
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,270
including that big formula,
which used to be --

296
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,080
those four As in a
row, but now it's

297
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,850
got Qs, because I'm projecting
onto the column space of Q,

298
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,280
so do you remember what it was?

299
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:21,200
It's Q Q transpose Q
inverse Q transpose.

300
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,890
That's my four Qs in a row.

301
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,190
But what's good here?

302
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,540
What -- what makes this formula
nice if I'm projecting onto

303
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,160
a column space when I have
orthonormal basis for that

304
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,940
space?

305
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,610
What makes it nice is
this is the identity.

306
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,860
I don't have to
do any inversion.

307
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,690
I just get Q Q transpose.

308
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,750
So Q Q transpose is
a projection matrix.

309
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,090
Oh, I can't help --

310
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,470
I can't resist just
checking the properties,

311
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,140
what are the properties
of a projection matrix?

312
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,780
There are two properties to
know for any projection matrix.

313
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,060
And I'm saying that this
is the right projection

314
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,000
matrix when we've got
this orthonormal basis

315
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,480
in the columns.

316
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,040
OK.

317
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,150
So there's the
projection matrix.

318
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,170
Suppose the matrix is square.

319
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,590
First just tell me
first this extreme case.

320
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,690
If my matrix is square and it's
got these orthonormal columns,

321
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,670
then what's the column space?

322
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,770
If I have a square matrix and
I have independent columns,

323
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,450
and even orthonormal columns,
then the column space

324
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,670
is the whole space, right?

325
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,750
And what's the projection
matrix onto the whole space?

326
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,290
The identity matrix.

327
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,860
If I'm projecting
in the whole space,

328
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,190
every vector B is right
where it's supposed to be

329
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,310
and I don't have to
move it by projection.

330
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:13,300
So this would be --

331
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,890
I'll put in parentheses
this is I if Q is square.

332
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,860
Well that we said that already.

333
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,490
If Q is square, that's the case
where Q transpose is Q inverse,

334
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,640
we can put it on the right,
we can put it on the left,

335
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,500
we always get the identity
matrix, if it's square.

336
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,570
But if it's not a square
matrix then it's not --

337
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,010
we don't get the
identity matrix.

338
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:53,210
We have Q Q transpose,
and just again

339
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,550
what are those two properties
of a projection matrix?

340
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,900
First of all, it's symmetric.

341
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,370
OK, no problem, that's
certainly a symmetric So what's

342
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,360
that second property
of a projection?

343
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,860
matrix.

344
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,510
That if you project and project
again you don't move the second

345
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,260
time.

346
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,720
So the other property
of a projection matrix

347
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,570
should be that Q
Q transpose twice

348
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,820
should be the same as
Q Q transpose once.

349
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,050
That's projection matrices.

350
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,670
And that property
better fall out

351
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,040
right away because
from the fact we

352
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,560
know about orthonormal matrices,
Q transpose Q is I. OK,

353
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,510
you see it.

354
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,820
In the middle here is sitting
Q Q t- Q transpose Q, sorry,

355
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,530
that's what I meant to
say, Q transpose Q is I.

356
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,500
So that's sitting right in
the middle, that cancels out,

357
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,260
to give the identity, we're
left with one Q Q transpose,

358
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,980
and we're all set.

359
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,680
OK.

360
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,340
So this is the
projection matrix --

361
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:10,170
all the equation -- all the
messy equations of this chapter

362
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,870
become trivial
when our matrix --

363
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,040
when we have this
orthonormal basis.

364
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,130
I mean what do I mean
by all the equations?

365
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,780
Well, the most
important equation

366
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,180
was the normal equation, do
you remember old A transpose

367
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:31,120
A x hat equals A transpose b?

368
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,700
But now -- now A is Q.

369
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:43,640
Now I'm thinking I have
Q transpose Q X hat

370
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,500
equals Q transpose b.

371
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,780
And what's good about that?

372
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,450
What's good is that matrix on
the left side is the identity.

373
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,610
The matrix on the left is
the identity, Q transpose Q,

374
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,010
normally it isn't, normally it's
that matrix of inner products

375
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,370
and you've to compute all those
dopey inner products and --

376
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,530
and -- and solve the system.

377
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,450
Here the inner products
are all one or zero.

378
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,040
This is the identity matrix.

379
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,780
It's gone.

380
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,410
And there's the answer.

381
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,640
There's no inversion involved.

382
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,230
Each component of
x is a Q times b.

383
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,740
What that equation is saying
is that the i-th component is

384
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,920
the i-th basis vector times b.

385
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:50,260
That's -- probably the most
important formula in some major

386
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:56,220
parts of mathematics, that
if we have orthonormal basis,

387
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:03,160
then the component in the --
in the i-th, along the i-th --

388
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:10,130
the projection on the i-th basis
vector is just qi transpose b.

389
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:16,080
That number x that we look
for is just a dot product.

390
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,580
OK.

391
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:25,540
OK, so I'm ready now for
the sort of like second half

392
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,030
of the lecture.

393
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,820
Where we don't start with
an orthogonal matrix,

394
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,410
orthonormal vectors.

395
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,110
We just start with
independent vectors

396
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,870
and we want to make
them orthonormal.

397
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,360
So I'm going to --
can I do that now?

398
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,440
Now here comes Graham-Schmidt.

399
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,990
So -- Graham-Schmidt.

400
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,490
So this is a calculation,
I won't say --

401
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:08,690
I can't quite say it's like
elimination, because it's

402
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,130
different, our goal
isn't triangular anymore.

403
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,280
With elimination our goal was
make the matrix triangular.

404
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,700
Now our goal is make
the matrix orthogonal.

405
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,080
Make those columns orthonormal.

406
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,740
So let me start
with two columns.

407
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,505
So I start with vectors a and b.

408
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,930
And they're just like --
here, let me draw them.

409
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,280
Here's a.

410
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,905
Here's b.

411
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,080
For example.

412
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,200
A isn't specially
horizontal, wasn't

413
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,650
meant to be, just a is
one vector, b is another.

414
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,540
I want to produce
those two vectors,

415
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,260
they might be in
twelve-dimensional space,

416
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,440
or they might be in
two-dimensional space.

417
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,800
They're independent, anyway.

418
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,000
So I better be sure I say that.

419
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,830
I start with
independent vectors.

420
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,000
And I want to produce
out of that q 1 and q2,

421
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,470
I want to produce
orthonormal vectors.

422
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,230
And Graham and
Schmidt tell me how.

423
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,760
OK.

424
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,830
Well, actually you could tell me
how, we don't need -- frankly,

425
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,300
I don't know -- there's
only one idea here,

426
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:40,350
if Graham had the idea, I
don't know what Schmidt did.

427
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,640
But OK.

428
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,970
So you'll see it.

429
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,400
We don't need either
of them, actually.

430
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,130
OK, so what I going to do.

431
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,130
I'll take that --
this first guy.

432
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,470
OK.

433
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,290
Well, he's fine.

434
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,120
That direction is fine except --

435
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,800
yeah, I'll say OK, I'll
settle for that direction.

436
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,910
So I'm going to --

437
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,130
I'm going to get, so
what I going to --

438
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:14,870
my goal is I'm going to
get orthogonal vectors

439
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,280
and I'll call those
capital A and B.

440
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,090
So that's the key step is
to get from any two vectors

441
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,930
to two orthogonal vectors.

442
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:30,030
And then at the end, no problem,
I'll get orthonormal vectors,

443
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:36,130
how will -- what will those
will be my qs, q1 and q2,

444
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:36,950
and what will they

445
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,450
be?

446
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,770
Once I've got A and B
orthogonal, well, look,

447
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:50,890
it's no big deal -- maybe
that's what Schmidt did, he,

448
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,340
brilliant Schmidt, thought
OK, divide by the length,

449
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,810
all right.

450
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,325
That's Schmidt's contribution.

451
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,640
OK.

452
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,120
But Graham had a little
more thinking to do, right?

453
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,280
We haven't done Graham's part.

454
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,550
This part except OK,
I'm happy with A,

455
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:22,670
A can be A. That first
direction is fine.

456
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,120
Why should -- no
complaint about that.

457
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,120
The trouble is the second
direction is not fine.

458
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,670
Because it's not
orthogonal to the first.

459
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:39,210
I'm looking for a vector
that's -- starts with B,

460
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:45,050
but makes it orthogonal to A.

461
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,480
What's the vector?

462
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,370
How do I do that?

463
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,460
How do I produce
from this vector

464
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:57,320
a piece that's
orthogonal to this one?

465
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,400
And the -- remember these
vectors might be in two

466
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,070
dimensions or they might
be in twelve dimensions.

467
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,710
I'm just looking for the idea.

468
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,340
So what's the idea?

469
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,610
Where did we have orthogonal --

470
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,940
a vector showing up that
was orthogonal to this guy?

471
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,490
Well, that was the
first basic calculation

472
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,280
of the whole chapter.

473
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,350
We -- we did a projection and
the projection gave us this

474
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:31,390
part, which was the
part in the A direction.

475
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:35,000
Now, the part we want is
the other part, the e part.

476
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,550
This part.

477
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,290
This is going to be our --

478
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,950
that guy is that guy.

479
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:46,610
This is our vector B. That gives
us that ninety-degree angle.

480
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,740
So B is you could say --

481
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,230
B is really what we
previously called

482
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,640
e.

483
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,560
The error vector.

484
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,450
And what is it?

485
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,450
I mean what do I
-- what is B here?

486
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,190
A is A, no problem.

487
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,910
B is --

488
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,620
OK, what's this error piece?

489
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,030
Do you remember?

490
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:19,650
It's I start with the original
B and I take away what?

491
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:24,170
Its projection, this P.
This -- the vector B,

492
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,660
this error vector, is the
original vector removing

493
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,390
the projection.

494
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:31,090
So instead of wanting
the projection,

495
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,760
now that's what I
want to throw away.

496
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,280
I want to get the part
that's perpendicular.

497
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,220
And there will be a
perpendicular part,

498
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:40,955
it won't be zero.

499
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:48,380
Because these vectors
were independent, so B --

500
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,380
if B was along the
direction of A,

501
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,330
then if the original B and A
were in the same direction,

502
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,260
then I'm --

503
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,000
I've only got one direction.

504
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,940
But here they're in two
independent directions

505
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,690
and all I'm doing
is getting that guy.

506
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,050
So what's its formula?

507
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,010
What's the formula
for that if --

508
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,040
I want to subtract
the projection,

509
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,950
so do you remember
the projection?

510
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:18,990
It's some multiple of A
and what's that multiple?

511
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,530
It's -- it's that thing we
called x in the very very first

512
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,650
lecture on this chapter.

513
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:32,040
There's an A transpose
A in the bottom

514
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:39,495
and there's an A transpose
B, isn't that it?

515
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,740
I think that's Graham's formula.

516
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,800
Or Graham-Schmidt.

517
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,100
No, that's Graham.

518
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,620
Schmidt has got to divide the
whole thing by the length,

519
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,160
so he --

520
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,780
his formula makes a mess which
I'm not willing to write down.

521
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:03,570
So let's just see that
what I saying here?

522
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,170
I'm saying that this vector
is perpendicular to A.

523
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,760
That these are orthogonal.

524
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,210
A is perpendicular to B.

525
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,990
Can you check that?

526
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,930
How do you see that
yes, of course, we --

527
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,660
our picture is telling
us, yes, we did it right.

528
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:24,224
How would I check that this
matrix is perpendicular to A?

529
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:32,240
I would multiply by A transpose
and I better get zero, right?

530
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,910
I should check that.

531
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,430
A transpose B should
come out zero.

532
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,420
So this is A transpose times
-- now what did we say B was?

533
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,870
We start with the original
B, and we take away

534
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:53,590
this projection, and that
should come out zero.

535
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,450
Well, here we get an
A transpose B minus --

536
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,550
and here is another A
transpose B, and the --

537
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,620
and it's an A transpose A
over A transpose A, a one,

538
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,340
those cancel, and
we do get zero.

539
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:09,840
Right.

540
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:21,449
Now I guess I can
do numbers in there.

541
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:24,920
But I have to take
a third vector

542
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,830
to be sure we've got
this system down.

543
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:35,750
So now I have to say if I have
independent vectors A, B and C,

544
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:41,320
I'm looking for orthogonal
vectors A, B and capital C,

545
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,670
and then of course the
third guy will just

546
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:48,479
be C over its length,
the unit vector.

547
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,489
So this is now the problem.

548
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:58,430
I got B here.

549
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,390
I got A very easily.

550
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:08,110
And now -- if you see the idea,
we could figure out a formula

551
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:16,890
for C. So now that -- so this
is like a typical homework quiz

552
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,650
problem.

553
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:22,760
I give you two vectors, you do
this, I give you three vectors,

554
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,960
and you have to make
them orthonormal.

555
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,020
So you do this again,
the first vector's fine,

556
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,660
the second vector is
perpendicular to the first,

557
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,220
and now I need a
third vector that's

558
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,740
perpendicular to the first
one and the second one.

559
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,060
Right?

560
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,160
Tthis is the end of a -- the
lecture is to find this guy.

561
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,480
Find this vector -- this vector
C, that's perpendicular we n-

562
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,910
at this point we know A and B.

563
00:35:54,910 --> 00:36:00,040
But C, the little c that
we're given, is off in some --

564
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,530
it's got to come out of the
blackboard to be independent,

565
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,949
so -- so can I sort of draw
off -- off comes a c somewhere.

566
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:09,740
I don't know, where I
going to put the darn

567
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,550
thing?

568
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:14,950
Maybe I'll put it
off, oh, I don't know,

569
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,660
like that somehow, C, little c.

570
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,430
And I already know that
perpendicular direction,

571
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,250
that one and that one.

572
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,300
So now what's the idea?

573
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,580
Give me the Graham-Schmidt
formula for C.

574
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,200
What is this C here?

575
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,020
Equals what?

576
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,660
What I going to do?

577
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,800
I'll start with the given one.

578
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,230
As before.

579
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,780
Right?

580
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,910
I start with the
vector I'm given.

581
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,900
And what do I do with it?

582
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,560
I want to remove out of
it, I want to subtract off,

583
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,010
so I'll put a minus sign
in, I want to subtract off

584
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:08,510
its components in the A, capital
A and capital B directions.

585
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,350
I just want to get
those out of there.

586
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,790
Well, I know how to do that.

587
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,210
I did it with B.

588
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,910
So I'll just -- so
let me take away --

589
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,940
what if I do this?

590
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,350
What have I done?

591
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,020
I've got little c and what
have I subtracted from it?

592
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:37,780
Its component, its projection
if you like, in the A direction.

593
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:46,320
And now I've got to subtract
off its component B transpose

594
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,700
C over B transpose B,
that multiple of B,

595
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,075
is its component
in the B direction.

596
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:02,980
And that gives me the vector
capital C that if anything is

597
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,660
--

598
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:10,200
if there's any justice, this
C should be perpendicular to A

599
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,250
and it should be
perpendicular to B.

600
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,160
And the only thing it's --
hasn't got is unit vector,

601
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,330
so we divide by its
length to get that too.

602
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,890
OK.

603
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:30,440
Let me do an example.

604
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,910
Can I --

605
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:36,490
I'll make my life easy,
I'll just take two vectors.

606
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,380
So let me do a
numerical example.

607
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,980
If I'll give you
two vectors, you

608
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,720
give me back the Graham-Schmidt
orthonormal basis,

609
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,490
and we'll see how to
express that in matrix form.

610
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,030
OK.

611
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:56,580
So let me give you
the two vectors.

612
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:01,920
So I'll take the vector A
equals let's say one, one, one,

613
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,410
why not?

614
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:11,316
And B equals let's say
one, zero, two, OK?

615
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,800
I didn't want to cheat
and make them orthogonal

616
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,830
in the first place because
then Graham-Schmidt

617
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,931
wouldn't be needed.

618
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:24,430
OK.

619
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,260
So those are not orthogonal.

620
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,830
So what is capital A?

621
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,780
Well that's the same as big A.

622
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,850
That was fine.

623
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:34,090
What's B?

624
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,100
So B is this b --
is the original B,

625
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:45,180
and then I subtract off
some multiple of the A.

626
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,400
And what's the multiple?

627
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,020
What goes in here?

628
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,740
B -- here's the A -- this is
the -- this is the little b,

629
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,930
this is the big A, also
the little a, and I want

630
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,180
to multiply it by that
right -- that right ratio,

631
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,980
which has A transpose
A, here's my ratio.

632
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,600
I'm just doing this.

633
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,110
So it's A transpose B,
what is A transpose B,

634
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,290
it looks like three.

635
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:22,280
And what is A -- oh, my --

636
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,971
what's A transpose A?

637
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:24,470
Three.

638
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,190
I'm sorry.

639
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,490
I didn't know that
was going to happen.

640
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:30,990
OK.

641
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,940
But it happened.

642
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,250
Why should we knock it?

643
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,110
OK.

644
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,930
So do you see it all right?

645
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,540
That's A transpose B,
there's A transpose A, that's

646
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,140
the fraction, so
I take this away,

647
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,140
and I get one take away one
is a zero, zero minus this one

648
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:54,680
is a minus one, and two
minus the one is a one.

649
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,430
OK.

650
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,830
And what's this vector
that we finally found?

651
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:02,520
This is B.

652
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,080
And how do I know it's right?

653
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,190
How do I know I've
got a vector I want?

654
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,200
I check that B is
perpendicular to --

655
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,480
that A and B are perpendicular.

656
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,780
That A is perpendicular to B.

657
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,690
Just look at that.

658
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,050
That one -- the dot product
of that with that is zero.

659
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,680
OK.

660
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,355
So now what is my q1 and q2?

661
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,200
Why don't I put
them in a matrix?

662
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,980
Of course.

663
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,470
Since I'm always putting
these -- so the Q,

664
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,760
I'll put the q1 and
the q2 in a matrix.

665
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,220
And what are they?

666
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,200
Now when I'm writing
q-s I'm supposed

667
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,700
to make things normalized.

668
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,950
I'm supposed to make
things unit vectors.

669
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,240
So I'm going to take that A
but I'm going to divide it

670
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,150
by square root of three.

671
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,280
And I'm going to
take this B but I'm

672
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,870
going to divide it
by square root of two

673
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:13,226
to make it a unit vector,
and there is my matrix.

674
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,930
That's my matrix with
orthonormal columns coming from

675
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:24,290
Graham-Schmidt and
it sort of it --

676
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:30,240
it came from the original
one, one, one, one, zero, two,

677
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:30,740
right?

678
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,120
That was my original guys.

679
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,700
These were the two
I started with.

680
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,450
These are the two that
I'm happy to end with.

681
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,610
Because those are orthonormal.

682
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,990
So that's what
Graham-Schmidt did.

683
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:53,550
It -- well, tell me about
the column spaces of these

684
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,760
matrices.

685
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,680
How is the column space of Q
related to the column space of

686
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,400
A?

687
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,650
So I'm always asking
you things like this,

688
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,470
and that makes you think,
OK, the column space

689
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:10,050
is all combinations of the
columns, it's that plane,

690
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,040
right?

691
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,270
I've got two vectors in
three-dimensional space,

692
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:19,130
their column space is a plane,
the column space of this matrix

693
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:23,700
is a plane, what's the
relation between the planes?

694
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,245
Between the two column spaces?

695
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,690
They're one and the same, right?

696
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,260
It's the same column space.

697
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:39,080
All I'm taking is here this
B thing that I computed,

698
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:45,620
this B thing that I computed
is a combination of B and A,

699
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:50,130
and A was little A, so
I'm always working here

700
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,420
with this in the same space.

701
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:57,950
I'm just like getting
ninety-degree angles in there.

702
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:02,950
Where my original column space
had a perfectly good basis,

703
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,970
but it wasn't as
good as this basis,

704
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:09,110
because it wasn't orthonormal.

705
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:15,060
Now this one is orthonormal,
and I have a basis then that --

706
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,550
so now projections, all the
calculations I would ever want

707
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:25,070
to do are -- are a cinch
with this orthonormal basis.

708
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,210
One final point.

709
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,980
One final point in this chapter.

710
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,740
And it's -- just
like elimination.

711
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,030
We learned how to
do elimination,

712
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,660
we know all the
steps, we can do it.

713
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:50,220
But then I came back to it and
said look at it as a matrix

714
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:55,640
in matrix language and
elimination gave me --

715
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,980
what was elimination
in matrix language?

716
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,500
I'll just put it up there.

717
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,740
A was LU.

718
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,220
That was matrix,
that was elimination.

719
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,680
Now, I want to do the
same for Graham-Schmidt.

720
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,700
Everybody who works
in linear algebra

721
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,030
isn't going to write
out the columns

722
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,720
are orthogonal, or orthonormal.

723
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,030
And isn't going to write
out these formulas.

724
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:24,320
They're going to write out the
connection between the matrix A

725
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,820
and the matrix Q.

726
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,730
And the two matrices have
the same column space,

727
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:33,220
but there's some -- some
matrix is taking the --

728
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:40,611
and I'm going to call it R, so
A equals QR is the magic formula

729
00:45:40,611 --> 00:45:41,110
here.

730
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,765
It's the expression
of Graham-Schmidt.

731
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,930
And I'll -- let me
just capture that.

732
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:57,740
So that's the -- my final
step then is A equal QR.

733
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,810
Maybe I can squeeze it in here.

734
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,460
So A has columns,
let's say a1 and a2.

735
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,650
Let me suppose n is
two, just two vectors.

736
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,790
OK.

737
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:21,800
So that's some
combination of q1 and q2.

738
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:28,670
And times some matrix R.

739
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:31,830
They have the same column space.

740
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,920
This is just -- this matrix just
includes in it whatever these

741
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,930
numbers like three over three
and one over square root

742
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,860
of three and one over
square root of two,

743
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,900
probably that's what it's got.

744
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,640
One over square root of three,
one over square root of two,

745
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,890
something there, but actually
it's got a zero there.

746
00:46:53,190 --> 00:47:00,760
So the main point about
this A equal QR is this R

747
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,770
turns out to be
upper triangular.

748
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,258
It turns out that this
zero is upper triangular.

749
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,940
We could see why.

750
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,140
Let me see, I can put in
general formulas for what these

751
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,699
This I think in here should
be the inner product of a1

752
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:21,240
with q1. are.

753
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,660
And this one should be the --

754
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,730
the inner product of a1 with q2.

755
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:34,470
And that's what I
believe is zero.

756
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:40,610
This will be something here,
and this will be something here

757
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:49,460
with inner -- a1 transpose q2,
sorry a2 transpose q1 and a2

758
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,560
transpose q2.

759
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,635
But why is that guy zero?

760
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,400
Why is a1 q2 zero?

761
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,080
That's the key to this being
-- this R here being upper

762
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,610
triangular.

763
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:10,600
You know why a1q2 is
zero, because a1 --

764
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,810
that was my --

765
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,680
this was really a and b here.

766
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,200
This was really a and b.

767
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,280
So this is a transpose q2.

768
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,880
And the whole point of
Graham-Schmidt was that we

769
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,320
constructed these later q-s to
be perpendicular to the earlier

770
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,530
vectors, to the earlier --
all the earlier vectors.

771
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,590
So that's why we get
a triangular matrix.

772
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:45,252
The -- result is
extremely satisfactory.

773
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:52,950
That if I have a matrix
with independent columns,

774
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:56,040
the Graham-Schmidt
produces a matrix

775
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,280
with orthonormal columns, and
the connection between those

776
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,730
is a triangular matrix.

777
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:06,700
That last point, that the
connection is a triangular

778
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,010
matrix, please look
in the book, you

779
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,890
have to see that one more time.

780
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:12,430
OK.

781
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:14,670
Thanks, that's great.
