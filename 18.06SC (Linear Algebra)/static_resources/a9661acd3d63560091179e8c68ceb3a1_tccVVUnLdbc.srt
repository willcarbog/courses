MARTINA BALAGOVIC: Hi.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,760
Welcome to recitation.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,920
Today's problem is about
positive definite matrices.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,560
And it's asking us: for
which values of the parameter

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,500
c, which is sitting here in the
matrix, is the matrix B-- 2,

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,640
minus 1, minus 1; minus 1, 2,
minus 1; minus 1, minus 1, 2

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,250
plus c-- positive definite,
and for which values of c

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,593
is it positive semidefinite?

9
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:32,509
I'm going to leave you
alone with the problem.

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,967
You should pause
the video and then

11
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,080
come back and compare
your solution with mine.

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,254
And we're back.

13
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:45,670
As you remember
from the lectures,

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,820
there are several tests that you
can do on matrices to find out

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,740
if they're positive
definite and if they're

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,110
positive semidefinite.

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,940
And I'm going to
demonstrate three to you.

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,200
First, I'm going to do the
one that you should do in case

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,700
you have very little
time and you're

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,700
asked to do a problem like
this on the test, which is

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,181
of course the determinant test.

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,740
The determinant test
asks us to compute

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,700
determinants of the matrices
in the upper left corner

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,396
of all sizes.

25
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:26,520
And it says that it's going
to be positive definite

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,600
if they're all greater than
0 and positive semidefinite

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,730
if some 0's sneak
into that sequence.

28
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,860
So let's calculate
the determinants.

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,060
The first determinant is the
determinant of this tiny matrix

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,930
here.

31
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,400
So it's just 2.

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,140
The next one is the determinant
of this two by two submatrix,

33
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:56,790
2, minus 1; minus 1, 2; which is
equal to 4 minus 1, which is 3.

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,330
And finally, we
have the determinant

35
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,880
of B, which I'm going
to calculate for you.

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,610
I'm going to calculate
it, I'm going

37
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,810
to decompose it along the
first line, first row.

38
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:25,870
So it's 2 times the determinant
of this submatrix, 2, minus 1;

39
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:32,970
minus 1, 2 plus c; minus
minus 1, this one here,

40
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,390
times this determinant,
which is minus 1, minus 1;

41
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,340
minus 1, 2 plus c.

42
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:52,360
And then plus minus 1, this one
here, times this determinant,

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,280
which is minus 1,
2; minus 1, minus 1.

44
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:13,390
And in total, that's 2 times
4 plus 2c minus 1 plus minus 2

45
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:25,440
minus c minus 1
and minus 1 plus 2.

46
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,880
And in total, this
should give us

47
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:40,030
6 plus 4c minus 3 minus
c minus 3, which is 3c.

48
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,030
So let's look at
the determinants.

49
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,130
2 is positive.

50
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,440
3 is positive.

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,080
3c is positive.

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,930
So the answer is: the
matrix is positive definite

53
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:58,500
if c is bigger than 0, and
it's positive semidefinite

54
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,970
if it's either strictly
bigger than 0 or equal to 0.

55
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,770
And that's all.

56
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,160
If you're on the test, this is
everything that you should do.

57
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,350
Now let me show
you two more tests

58
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,700
to demonstrate that first, they
take longer, and second, to see

59
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,090
these numbers and
their quotients show up

60
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,940
in other tests and to
try to convince you

61
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,295
that these tests
really are equivalent.

62
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:22,060
Let me do the
pivots test for you.

63
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,160
So we take our matrix B, 2,
minus 1, minus 1; minus 1, 2,

64
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,520
minus 1; minus 1,
minus 1, 2 plus c.

65
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,570
And let's pretend we're
solving a system that

66
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,550
has this as a matrix.

67
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,930
So we multiply the
first row by 1/2,

68
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,120
and we add it to the second
and to the third row.

69
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:08,630
We get 2, minus 1, minus 1; 0,
3/2, minus 3/2; 0, minus 3/2,

70
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,400
3/2 plus c.

71
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,450
So the first column is good.

72
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,270
And then we just
replace the third column

73
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,330
with the third column
plus the second column.

74
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:36,450
And we get 2, minus 1, minus 1;
0, 3/2, minus 3/2; 0, 0, and c.

75
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:44,920
And so the pivots
are 2, 3/2, and c.

76
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,730
And again, the
answer is as before.

77
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,460
It's positive definite if c
is strictly bigger than 0,

78
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,880
and it's positive semidefinite
if c is greater or equal to 0.

79
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,950
But I want you to notice
something else here.

80
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,670
So before, we had 2, 3, and 3c.

81
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,630
And now for determinants,
as these pivots,

82
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,350
we have 2, 3/2, which is
the second determinant

83
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,760
over the first
determinant, and c,

84
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,510
which can be thought
of as 3c over 3,

85
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,180
so the third determinant
over the second determinant.

86
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,310
And something like this
is always going to happen.

87
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:29,450
And finally, let me do the
energy test, or completing

88
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,050
the square.

89
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,850
So one of the definitions
of positive definite,

90
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,350
one could say the
definition because

91
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,650
of which we are really
interested in such matrices,

92
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,910
is the following.

93
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:57,540
It's positive definite
if, when we consider

94
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,880
this quadratic form,
so a form that maps

95
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,080
x, y, and z to this
expression here that's

96
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,950
going to be quadratic in
x, y, and z, it's positive

97
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,480
semidefinite if this is always
greater or equal than 0.

98
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,330
And it's positive
definite if, when

99
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,810
we have an expression like this
and try to solve this equals 0,

100
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,470
the only solution is that x,
y, and z all have to be 0.

101
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,790
So let's try
calculating this form,

102
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,380
completing the squares on
it, and seeing these numbers

103
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,890
show up again.

104
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,510
So when I multiply this
like this, put in a B,

105
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,415
do the multiplication, we
get something like this.

106
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:53,740
2 x squared plus 2 y squared
plus 2 plus c z squared minus

107
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,290
2x*y minus 2x*z minus 2y*z.

108
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,620
And now let's try completing
the squares using the formulas

109
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,000
that I prepared for you up
here in this pop-up window

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,430
in the corner.

111
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,600
So let's try
completing-- we have

112
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,880
a formula for the
square of a plus

113
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,150
b plus c and the
square of a plus b.

114
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:26,870
So first, we try to get
something squared so that this

115
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,910
something has all the
x's that appear here,

116
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,929
so that we get something squared
plus some expression that only

117
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,010
takes y's and z's.

118
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,299
I'm not going to do the
calculation in front of you

119
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,490
to further embarrass
myself with it.

120
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,610
But let me tell you
that what you get

121
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:52,890
is 2 times x minus 1/2
y minus 1/2 z squared.

122
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,320
And this ate all the
x's that showed up here.

123
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,160
The remainder only
has y's and z's.

124
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,910
When you use the second of those
formulas in a pop-up window

125
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,830
to complete the square
of y's and z's, you

126
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:12,230
get 3/2 times y minus z squared.

127
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,940
So this took up all
the y's, and we're

128
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:22,900
left just with a z that
comes as c times z squared.

129
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,990
And now, let's look
at the following.

130
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,760
This is a square of
some real number.

131
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,560
So that's positive.

132
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,580
This is a square of some real
number, so that's positive.

133
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,430
And this is a square
of some real number,

134
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,800
so that's positive.

135
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,480
They're all multiplied by
positive numbers, 2, 3/2,

136
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,540
and c, which we've
already seen here.

137
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,000
And so if c is bigger
or equal than 0,

138
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,250
this is certainly always
bigger or equal than 0.

139
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,910
Now to the question of if this
can be equal to 0 without x, y,

140
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:02,640
and z all being 0, well,
let's look at two cases.

141
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,650
If c is strictly
bigger than 0, then

142
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:16,370
let me write this matrix
here as 2, 3/2 and c times 1,

143
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:26,370
minus 1/2, minus 1/2; 0,
1, minus 1; and 0, 0, 1.

144
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,440
Let's imagine c is
strictly bigger than 0.

145
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,050
And let's see when can this
expression be equal to 0.

146
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,460
Well, as we said, it's a
sum of certain squares.

147
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,940
They're all greater
or equal to 0,

148
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,150
so they all have to be equal to
0 for this expression to be 0.

149
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,300
In other words, z
needs to be equal to 0.

150
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,430
y minus z needs
to be equal to 0.

151
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:55,030
And x minus 1/2 y minus 1/2 z
also needs to be equal to 0.

152
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,940
And since this matrix
has all the pivots,

153
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,700
this can only happen if x,
y, and z are all equal to 0.

154
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:10,640
On the other hand,
if c is equal to 0,

155
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,220
then let me write this
matrix here again.

156
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,860
Take 2 out here.

157
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,750
Take 3/2 out here.

158
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:25,420
And write again 1, minus 1/2,
minus 1/2; 0, 1, minus 1;

159
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,130
and 0, 0, 0.

160
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,080
And so imagining that c is 0,
when can this whole expression

161
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,970
be equal to 0?

162
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,630
Well, the last bit is already 0.

163
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,850
We need to have y
minus z equal to 0.

164
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,510
And we need to have 1 times
x minus 1/2 times y minus 1/2

165
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,820
times z also equal to 0.

166
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,505
So we need to have x, y, z
in the kernel of this matrix.

167
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,790
But this matrix
only has two pivots.

168
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,710
It has one free variable.

169
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,805
So we can find a
solution to this times x,

170
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:02,890
y, z equals 0
that's not 0 itself.

171
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,620
Namely, if you remember how
to solve systems like this,

172
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,370
we set z equal to 1.

173
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,080
From this, we calculate
that y has to be 1.

174
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,170
And then from this, we
calculate that x has to be 1.

175
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:28,180
And you can check that for
in case c is 0, this thing

176
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:35,360
here, when you plug it in
here, you really get 0.

177
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,410
In fact, this thing
here is in the kernel

178
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,327
of the matrix B.
In fact, in case c

179
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,600
is 0, the columns of matrix
B sum up to 0 because of this

180
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,240
here.

181
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,230
And that's all I wanted
to say for today.
