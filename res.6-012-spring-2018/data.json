These tools underlie important advances in many fields, from the basic sciences to engineering and management.\n\nThis resource is a companion site to [6.041SC Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability](/courses/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/). It covers the same content, using videos developed for an [edX](https://www.edx.org/) version of the course.\n",
