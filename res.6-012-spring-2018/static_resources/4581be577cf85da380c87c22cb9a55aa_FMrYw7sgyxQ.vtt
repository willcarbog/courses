00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.250
In the previous lecture, we
went through examples of

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.830
inference involving some
of the variations

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.590
of the Bayes rule.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.730
One case that we did not
consider was the case where

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.970
the unknown random variable and
the observation are both

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.520
continuous.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.740
In this lecture, we will focus
exclusively on an important

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.150
model of this kind.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.960
And because we consider only one
specific setting, we will

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.060
be able to start it in
considerable detail.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.950
In the model that we consider,
we start with some basic

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.660
independent normal
random variables.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.540
Some of them, the Theta j, are
unknown, to be estimated.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.110
And some of them, the
Wi, represent noise.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.900
Our observations, Xi, are linear
functions of these

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.650
basic random variables.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.810
In particular, since linear
functions of independent

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.140
normal random variables are
normal, the observations are

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.450
themselves normal as well.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.920
This is probably the most
commonly used type of model in

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.569
all of inference
and statistics.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.120
This is because it is a
reasonable approximation in

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.510
many situations.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.090
Also, it has a very clean
analytical structure and a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.210
very simple solution.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.860
For example, it turns out that
the posterior distribution of

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.890
each Theta j is itself normal
and that the MAP and LMS

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.110
estimates coincide.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.950
This is because the peak of a
normal occurs at the mean.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.650
Furthermore, these estimates
are given by some simple

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.550
linear functions of
the observations.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.890
We will go over these facts by
moving through a sequence of

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.890
progressively more
complex versions.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.700
We will start with just one
unknown and one observation

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.400
and then generalize.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.350
And we will illustrate the
formulation and the solution

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.050
through a rather realistic
example where we estimate the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.960
trajectory of an object from
a few noisy measurements.
