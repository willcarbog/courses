00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.610
In the previous lecture we
introduced random variables,

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.050
probability mass functions
and expectations.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.170
In this lecture we continue
with the development of

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.190
various concepts associated
with random variables.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.950
There will be three
main parts.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.780
In the first part we define
the variance of a random

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.750
variable, and calculate
it for some of our

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.150
familiar random variables.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.050
Basically the variance is a
quantity that measures the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.900
amount of spread, or the
dispersion of a probability

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.310
mass functions.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.780
In some sense, it quantifies the
amount of randomness that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.210
is present.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.870
Together with the expected
value, the variance summarizes

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.890
crisply some of the qualitative
properties of the

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.840
probability mass function.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.500
In the second part we discuss
conditioning.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.670
Every probabilistic concept or
result has a conditional

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.850
counterpart.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.680
And this is true for probability
mass functions,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.250
expectations and variances.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.160
We define these conditional
counterparts and then develop

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.850
the total expectation theorem.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.270
This is a powerful tool that
extends our familiar total

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.050
probability theorem and allows
us to divide and conquer when

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.820
we calculate expectations.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.360
We then take the opportunity
to dive deeper into the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.450
properties of geometric random
variables, and use a trick

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.990
based on the total expectation
theorem to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.039
calculate their mean.

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.300
In the last part we show how to
describe probabilistically

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.520
the relation between multiple
random variables.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.570
This is done through a so-called
joint probability

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.360
mass function.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.380
We take the occasion to
generalize the expected value

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.280
rule, and establish a further
linearity property of

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.990
expectations.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.650
We finally illustrate the power
of these tools through

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.060
the calculation of the expected
value of a binomial

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.310
random variable.
