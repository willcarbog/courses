00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.890
So we have reached
the final lecture

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.860
of this class which
will also conclude

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.810
our study of discrete
time, finite state space

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.640
Markov chains.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.490
We will first review the
steady-state behavior

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.720
of Markov chains.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.562
Then, we are going to talk
about a classical application

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:23.620
of Markov chains to analyze
the design of a phone system.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.670
And finally, we will
see how we can calculate

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.930
some interesting
quantities that have

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.300
to do with the behavior
of Markov chains

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.790
over a finite time horizon as
opposed to in the long run.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.770
So let us start.
