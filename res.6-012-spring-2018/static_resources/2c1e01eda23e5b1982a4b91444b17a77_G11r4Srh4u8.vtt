00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.530
In this lecture, we continue our
discussion of continuous

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.410
random variables.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.580
We will start by bringing
conditioning into the picture

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.190
and discussing how the PDF of
a continuous random variable

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.220
changes when we are told that a
certain event has occurred.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.390
We will take the occasion to
develop counterparts of some

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.130
of the tools that we developed
in the discrete case such as

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.300
the total probability and total
expectation theorems.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.630
In fact, we will push the
analogy even further.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.930
In the discrete case, we looked
at the geometric PMF in

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.830
some detail and recognized an
important memorylessness

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.210
property that it possesses.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.130
In the continuous case, there is
an entirely analogous story

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.920
that we will follow, this time
involving the exponential

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.330
distribution which
has a similar

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.380
memorylessness property.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.210
We will then move to a second
theme which is how to describe

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.850
the joint distribution of
multiple random variables.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.910
We did this in the
discrete case by

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.670
introducing joint PMFs.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.620
In the continuous case, we
can do the same using

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.200
appropriately defined
joint PDFs and by

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.720
replacing sums by integrals.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.430
As usual, we will illustrate the
various concepts through

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.020
some simple examples and also
take the opportunity to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.860
introduce some additional
concepts such as mixed random

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.039
variables and the
joint cumulative

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.289
distribution function.
