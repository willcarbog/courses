00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.280
This lecture consists of two
parts that deal with two

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.590
rather different topics.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.220
In the first part, we look into
an important special case

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.410
of a derived distribution
problem.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.310
We start with two independent
random variables with known

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.140
distributions and wish to find
the distribution of their sum.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.600
We will see that for either the
discrete or the continuous

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.200
case, there is a nice formula
that gives us the answer.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.690
We will develop this formula and
then we will talk a little

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.310
bit about a graphical way
of carrying out the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.520
calculations involved.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.220
As we will discuss, this formula
also allows us to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.300
establish the very important
fact that the sum of two

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.600
independent, normal random
variables is normal.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.580
In the second part, we introduce
the covariance of

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.390
two random variables and the
correlation coefficient.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.360
These are certain quantities
that allow us to quantify the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.920
degree to which two dependent
random variables are related.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.960
For example, a high value of
the correlation coefficient

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.330
will indicate a strong
relation between

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.490
these random variables.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.140
We will see the basic
mathematical properties of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.870
these quantities and provide
some interpretation.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.000
Later on in this class, we will
see that they play an

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.580
important role in the problem
of estimating one random

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.750
variable, given the
value of another.
