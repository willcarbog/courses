1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This time, we started solving
differential equations.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,072
This is the third
lecture of the term,

3
00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:20,000
and I have yet to solve
a single differential

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
equation in this class.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,912
Well, that will be
rectified from now

6
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:27,500
until the end of the term.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,142
So, once you learn
separation of variables,

8
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:36,220
which is the most elementary
method there is, the single,

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,500
I think the single
most important equation

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,713
is the one that's called the
first order linear equation,

11
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:47,500
both because it
occurs frequently

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,725
in models because it's solvable,
and-- I think that's enough.

13
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:56,333
If you drop the
course after today

14
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,428
you will still have learned
those two important methods:

15
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:03,000
separation of variables, and
first order linear equations.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,750
So, what does such an
equation look like?

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, I'll write it in there.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,331
There are several
ways of writing it,

19
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:13,900
but I think the
most basic is this.

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm going to use x as
the independent variable

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
because that's what
your book does.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,568
But in the
applications, it's often

23
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:25,000
t, time, that is the
independent variable.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And, I'll try to give you
examples which show that.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So, the equation
looks like this.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,328
I'll find some
function of x times y

27
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,535
prime plus some other
function of x times y

28
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:40,000
is equal to yet
another function of x.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,999
Obviously, the x doesn't
have the same status

30
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:50,750
here that y does, so y is
extremely limited in how

31
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,000
it can appear in the equation.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But, x can be pretty much
arbitrary in those places.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So, that's the equation
we are talking about,

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,270
and I'll put it up.

35
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,496
This is the first version of
it, and we'll call them purple.

36
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:11,000
Now, why is that called
the linear equation?

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,998
The word linear is a
very heavily used word

38
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:18,800
in mathematics, science,
and engineering.

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,664
For the moment, the
best simple answer

40
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:27,571
is because it's linear in y
and y prime, the variables

41
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:31,000
y and y prime.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, y prime is not a variable.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, you will learn,
in a certain sense,

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
it helps to think of it as
one, not right now perhaps,

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,400
but think of it as linear.

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,664
The most closely analogous thing
would be a linear equation,

47
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:53,000
a real linear equation, the
kind you studied in high school,

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,500
which would look like this.

49
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,200
It would have two
variables, and, I guess,

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,428
constant coefficients, equal c.

51
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:05,000
Now, that's a linear equation.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And that's the sense in
which this is linear.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,072
It's linear in y
prime and y, which

54
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:15,776
are the analogs of the
variables y1 and y2.

55
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:20,664
A little bit of terminology,
if c is equal to zero,

56
00:03:20,664 --> 00:03:25,000
it's called homogeneous, the
same way this equation is

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,500
called homogeneous, as you know
from 18.02, if the right hand

58
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,000
side is zero.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, c of x I should
write here, but I won't.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,500
That's called homogeneous.

61
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,000
Now, this is a common
form for the equation,

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,142
but it's not what it's
called standard form.

63
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:51,664
The standard form for the
equation, and since this

64
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:58,332
is going to be a prime course
of confusion, which is probably

65
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:03,600
completely correct, but a
prime source of confusion

66
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,000
is what I meant.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,330
The standard linear
form, and I'll

68
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,912
underline linear is the
first co efficient of y prime

69
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:16,000
is taken to be one.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,160
So, you can always convert
that to a standard form

71
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,776
by simply dividing
through by it.

72
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:28,552
And if I do that, the equation
will look like y prime plus,

73
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:35,000
now, it's common to not call
it b anymore, the coefficient,

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,750
because it's really b over a.

75
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,000
And, therefore, it's
common to adopt, yet,

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
a new letter for it.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And, the standard one
that many people use is p.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,496
How about the right hand side?

79
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:53,200
We needed a letter
for that, too.

80
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,815
It's c over a, but
we'll call it q.

81
00:04:55,815 --> 00:04:59,665
So, when I talk about
the standard linear form

82
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:03,000
for a linear first
order equation,

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
it's absolutely that
that I'm talking about.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Now, you immediately
see that there

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,166
is a potential
for confusion here

86
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:21,250
because what did I call the
standard form for a first order

87
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,875
equation?

88
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:26,142
So, I'm going to say, not this.

89
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:31,400
The standard first order
form, what would that be?

90
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,776
Well, it would be y prime
equals, and everything else

91
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:39,000
on the left hand side.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,304
So, it would be y prime.

93
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:46,305
And now, if I turn this into
the standard first order form,

94
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:53,000
it would be negative
p of x y plus q of x.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,750
But, of course, nobody
would write negative p of x.

96
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,384
So, now, I explicitly
want to say

97
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:05,777
that this is a form which I will
never use for this equation,

98
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:12,000
although half the
books of the world do.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
In short, this poor little
first order equation

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,125
belongs to two ethnic groups.

101
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,375
It's both a first
order equation,

102
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:22,125
and therefore, its standard
form should be written this way,

103
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:26,664
but it's also a linear equation,
and therefore its standard form

104
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:28,570
should be used this way.

105
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,400
Well, it has to decide,
and I have decided for it.

106
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,875
It is, above all, a
linear equation, not just

107
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,600
a first order equation.

108
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,000
And, in this course, this will
always be the standard form.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Now, well, what on
earth is the difference?

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,744
If you don't do it that
way, the difference

111
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,800
is entirely in the sin(p).

112
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,816
But, if you get the sign
of p wrong in the answers,

113
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:01,000
it is just a disaster
from that point on.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,500
A trivial little change
of sign in the answer

115
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,500
produces solutions and
functions which have

116
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,888
totally different behavior.

117
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:14,452
And, you are going to be
really lost in this course.

118
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:17,888
So, maybe I should
draw a line through it

119
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:21,000
to indicate, please
don't pay any attention

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,856
to this whatsoever, except that
we are not going to do that.

121
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:29,998
Okay, well, what's so
important about this equation?

122
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:34,500
Well, number one, it
can always be solved.

123
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,000
That's a very, very big thing
in differential equations.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,724
But, it's also
the equation which

125
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:44,500
arises in a variety of models.

126
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,900
Now, I'm just going
to list a few of them.

127
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,227
All of them I think you will
need either in part one or part

128
00:07:54,227 --> 00:08:00,500
two of problem sets over these
first couple of problem sets,

129
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,000
or second and third maybe.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,152
But, of them, I'm going to put
at the very top of the list

131
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:16,800
of what I'll call here,
I'll give it two names:

132
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,600
the temperature
diffusion model, well, it

133
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,570
would be better to call it
temperature concentration

134
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:35,000
by analogy, temperature
concentration model.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There's the mixing model,
which is hardly less important.

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In other words, it's
almost as important.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You have that in
your problem set.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And then, there are other,
slightly less important models.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There is the model
of radioactive decay.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There's the model of a bank
interest, bank account,

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,428
various motion models, you
know, Newton's Law type problems

142
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:08,280
if you can figure
out a way of getting

143
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:15,000
rid of the second derivative,
some motion problems.

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
A classic example is the motion
of a rocket being fired off,

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,500
etc., etc., etc.

146
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,625
Now, today I have
to pick a model.

147
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:37,200
And, the one I'm going to
pick is this temperature

148
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,000
concentration model.

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So, this is going
to be today's model.

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,500
Tomorrow's model
in the recitation,

151
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm asking the recitations
to, among other things,

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,224
make sure they do a mixing
problem, A) to show you

153
00:09:54,224 --> 00:10:00,000
how to do it, and B) because
it's on the problem sets.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's not a good reason,
but it's not a bad one.

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,688
The others are
either in part one

156
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:10,452
or we will take them
up later in the term.

157
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:16,000
This is not going to be the only
lecture on the linear equation.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There will be another one
next week of equal importance.

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But, we can't do
everything today.

160
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,500
So, let's talk about the
temperature concentration

161
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,000
model, except I'm going
to change its name.

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm going to change its name to
the conduction diffusion model.

163
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll put conduction over
there, and diffusion over here,

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,428
let's say, since, as you
will see, the similarities,

165
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:52,428
they are practically
the same model.

166
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:56,250
All that's changed
from one to the other

167
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,000
is the name of the ideas.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
In one case, you
call it temperature,

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,800
and the other, you should
call it concentration.

170
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,332
But, the actual mathematics
isn't identical.

171
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,500
So, let's begin with conduction.

172
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,330
All right, so, I need a
simple physical situation

173
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,000
that I'm modeling.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So, imagine a tank
of some liquid.

175
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Water will do as
well as anything.

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,500
And, in the inside
is a suspended,

177
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,250
somehow, is a chamber.

178
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,665
A metal cube will
do, and let's suppose

179
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:43,332
that its walls are partly
insulated, not so much

180
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:46,000
that no heat can get through.

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,440
There is no such thing
as perfect insulation

182
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,000
anyway, except maybe an
absolute perfect vacuum.

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,500
Now, inside, so here on
the outside is liquid.

184
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,400
Okay, on the inside
is, what I'm interested

185
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,000
in is the temperature
of this thing.

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,666
I'll call that T. Now, that's
different from the temperature

187
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,000
of the external water bath.

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So, I'll call that T
sub e, T for temperature

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,500
measured in Celsius, let's say,
for the sake of definiteness.

190
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,625
But, this is the
external temperature.

191
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:33,000
So, I'll indicate it with an e.

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,775
Now, what is the model?

193
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:43,328
Well, in other words, how do I
set up a differential equation

194
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:46,000
to model the situation?

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, it's based on a physical
law, which I think you know,

196
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,362
you've had simple
examples like this,

197
00:12:57,362 --> 00:13:03,000
the so called Newton's
Law of cooling, -- --

198
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,545
which says that
the rate of change,

199
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:13,000
the temperature of the heat goes
from the outside to the inside

200
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,500
by conduction only.

201
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,140
Heat, of course, can
travel in various ways,

202
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,000
by convection, by conduction,
as here, or by radiation,

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,270
are the three most common.

204
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:31,332
Of these, I only want one,
namely transmission of heat

205
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:33,000
by conduction.

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,267
And, that's the way it's
probably a little better

207
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:41,000
to call it the conduction model,
rather than the temperature

208
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,086
model, which might involve
other ways for the heat

209
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:46,600
to be traveling.

210
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,333
So, dt, the
independent variable,

211
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:53,000
is not going to be x,
as it was over there.

212
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,688
It's going to be t for time.

213
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:59,000
So, maybe I should write
that down. t equals time.

214
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Capital T equals temperature
in degrees Celsius.

215
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So, you can put in the
degrees Celsius if you want.

216
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,375
So, it's proportional to
the temperature difference

217
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,750
between these two.

218
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,428
Now, how shall I
write the difference?

219
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:21,000
Write it this way because if you
don't you will be in trouble.

220
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Now, why do I write it that way?

221
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,664
Well, I write it
that way because I

222
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:32,000
want this constant to be
positive, a positive constant.

223
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,800
In general, any constant, so,
parameters which are physical,

224
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,726
have some physical
significance, one always

225
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:44,142
wants to arrange the equation so
that they are positive numbers,

226
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:47,855
the way people normally
think of these things.

227
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:49,600
This is called the conductivity.

228
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
The conductivity of what?

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,800
Well, I don't
know, of the system

230
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,080
of the situation, the
conductivity of the wall,

231
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,999
or the wall if the metal
were just by itself.

232
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:04,332
At any rate, it's a constant.

233
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:07,000
It's thought of as a constant.

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,142
And, why positive, well, because
if the external temperature is

235
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:14,000
bigger than the
internal temperature,

236
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,666
I expect T to rise, the
internal temperature to rise.

237
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:24,220
That means dT / dt, its
slope, should be positive.

238
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,500
So, in other words, if
Te is bigger than T,

239
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,375
I expect this number
to be positive.

240
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,452
And, that tells you that k
must be a positive constant.

241
00:15:33,452 --> 00:15:37,000
If I had turned it the
other way, expressed

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
the difference in
the reverse order,

243
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
K would then be negative,
have to be negative in order

244
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that this turn out to be
positive in that situation I

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,600
described.

246
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,200
And, since nobody wants
negative values of k,

247
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,999
you have to write the
equation in this form

248
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:56,000
rather than the
other way around.

249
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So, there's our
differential equation.

250
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It will probably have
an initial condition.

251
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,663
So, it could be the temperature
at the starting time should

252
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:10,000
be some given number, T zero.

253
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But, the condition could
be given in other ways.

254
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
One can ask, what's
the temperature as time

255
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
goes to infinity, for example?

256
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
There are different ways of
getting that initial condition.

257
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Okay, that's the
conduction model.

258
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What would the
diffusion model be?

259
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,142
The diffusion model,
mathematically, would be,

260
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:31,000
word for word, the same.

261
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,912
The only difference
is that now, what

262
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:38,270
I imagine is I'll draw
the picture the same way,

263
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:43,541
except now I'm going to put,
label the inside not with a T

264
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,665
but with a C, C
for concentration.

265
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:50,856
It's in an external
water bath, let's say.

266
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:53,571
So, there is an
external concentration.

267
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:57,888
And, what I'm talking
about is some chemical,

268
00:16:57,888 --> 00:17:02,250
let's say salt will do
as well as anything.

269
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:07,500
So, C is equal to salt
concentration inside,

270
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,714
and Ce would be the salt
concentration outside,

271
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:18,000
outside in the water bath.

272
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Now, I imagine some mechanism,
so this is a salt solution.

273
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,664
That's a salt solution.

274
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:34,178
And, I imagine some mechanism
by which the salt can diffuse,

275
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,999
it's a diffusion model
now, diffuse from here

276
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:40,000
into the air or possibly
out the other way.

277
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,500
And that's usually done
by vaguely referring

278
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,140
to the outside as a
semi permeable membrane,

279
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,080
semi permeable, so
that the salt will

280
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,750
have a little hard time
getting through but permeable,

281
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,800
so that it won't be
blocked completely.

282
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,000
So, there's a membrane.

283
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You write the semi
permeable membrane outside,

284
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,713
outside the inside.

285
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,000
Well, I give up.

286
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You know, membrane somewhere.

287
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Sorry, membrane wall.

288
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,332
How's that?

289
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:21,000
Now, what's the equation?

290
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,600
Well, the equation is
the same, except it's

291
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,500
called the diffusion equation.

292
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,284
I don't think Newton
got his name on this.

293
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:40,178
The diffusion equation says
that the rate at which the salt

294
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:42,384
diffuses across
the membrane, which

295
00:18:42,384 --> 00:18:47,000
is the same up to a constant
as the rate at which

296
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
the concentration inside
changes, is some constant,

297
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
usually called k still, okay.

298
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,332
Do I contradict?

299
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:58,000
Okay, let's keep calling it k1.

300
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Now it's different,
times Ce minus C.

301
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,800
And, for the same
reason as before,

302
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,142
if the external
concentration is bigger

303
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:12,724
than the internal concentration,
we expect salt to flow in.

304
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:15,000
That will make C rise.

305
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,307
It will make this
positive, and therefore, we

306
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:21,070
want k to be positive,
just k1 to be

307
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,000
positive for the same reason
it had to be positive before.

308
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,600
So, in each case, the model
that I'm talking about

309
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,000
is the differential equation.

310
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,500
So, maybe I should, let's
put that, make that clear.

311
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,713
Or, I would say that this first
order differential equation

312
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:43,332
models this physical
situation, and the same thing

313
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:46,000
is true on the other
side over here.

314
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,800
This is the diffusion
equation, and this

315
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,375
is the conduction equation.

316
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:55,220
Now, if you are in any doubt
about the power of differential

317
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,842
equations, the point is,
when I talk about this thing,

318
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:02,875
I don't have to say which
of these I'm following.

319
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:07,284
I'll use neutral
variables like Y and X

320
00:20:07,284 --> 00:20:09,000
to solve these equations.

321
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,600
But, with a single
stroke, I will be handling

322
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,750
those situations together.

323
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,500
And, that's the
power of the method.

324
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,200
Now, you obviously must
be wondering, look,

325
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,666
these look very, very special.

326
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:27,140
He said he was going to talk
about the first, general first

327
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,000
order equation.

328
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But, these look
rather special to me.

329
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,220
Well, not too special.

330
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,000
How should we write it?

331
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,332
Suppose I write, let's take
the temperature equation just

332
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:44,000
to have something definite.

333
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Notice that it's in a form
corresponding to Newton's Law.

334
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But it is not in the
standard linear form.

335
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,688
Let's put it in
standard linear form,

336
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:59,080
so at least you could see
that it's a linear equation.

337
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,384
So, if I put it
in standard form,

338
00:21:02,384 --> 00:21:06,224
it's going to look like
DTDTD little t plus KT

339
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,220
is equal to K times TE.

340
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,200
Now, compare that with
the general, the way

341
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,000
the general equation
is supposed to look,

342
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the yellow box over there,
the standard linear form.

343
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,998
How are they going to compare?

344
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:24,500
Well, this is a pretty
general function.

345
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,000
This is general.

346
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,840
This is a general function
of T because I can

347
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,428
make the external temperature.

348
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:37,000
I could suppose it behaves in
anyway I like, steadily rising,

349
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
decaying exponentially,
maybe oscillating

350
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,180
back and forth for some reason.

351
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,500
The only way in which
it's not general

352
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,000
is that this K is a constant.

353
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So, I will ask you
to be generous.

354
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Let's imagine the conductivity
is changing over time.

355
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,815
So, this is usually
constant, but there's

356
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:05,220
no law which says it has to be.

357
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,142
How could a conductivity
change over time?

358
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:12,888
Well, we could
suppose that this wall

359
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:17,142
was made of slowly congealing
Jell O, for instance.

360
00:22:17,142 --> 00:22:23,000
It starts out as liquid,
and then it gets solid.

361
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,444
And, Jell O doesn't
transmit heat,

362
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:32,180
I believe, quite as well as
liquid does, as a liquid would.

363
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,000
Is Jell O a solid or liquid?

364
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,713
I don't know.

365
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:40,000
Let's forget about that.

366
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So, with this understanding,
so let's say not necessarily

367
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,500
here, but not necessarily, I
can think of this, therefore,

368
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,000
by allowing K to vary with time.

369
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And the external temperature
to vary with time.

370
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I can think of it as a
general, linear equation.

371
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So, these models
are not special.

372
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,452
They are fairly general.

373
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:14,284
Well, I did promise you I
would solve an equation,

374
00:23:14,284 --> 00:23:18,000
and that this lecture, I still
have not solved any equations.

375
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
OK, time to stop
temporizing and solve.

376
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So, I'm going to, in order
not to play favorites

377
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
with these two models,
I'll go back to,

378
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and to get you used to thinking
of the variables all the time,

379
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,444
that is, you know, be eclectic
switching from one variable

380
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:38,552
to another according to
which particular lecture

381
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:42,635
you happened to be sitting in.

382
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:52,712
So, let's take our equation in
the form, Y prime plus P of XY,

383
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:58,000
the general form using
the old variables

384
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
equals Q of X. Solve me.

385
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,928
Well, there are different ways
of describing the solution

386
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:07,428
process.

387
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:10,614
No matter how you
do it, it amounts

388
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:13,684
to the same amount of
work and there is always

389
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:16,331
a trick involved
at each one of them

390
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,125
since you can't suppress
a trick by doing

391
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,000
the problem some other way.

392
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The way I'm going to do
it, I think, is the best.

393
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That's why I'm giving it to you.

394
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,815
It's the easiest to remember.

395
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:31,000
It leads to the
least work, but I

396
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
have colleagues who would
fight with me about that point.

397
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,330
So, since they are not
here to fight with me

398
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,332
I am free to do whatever I like.

399
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:45,400
One of the main
reasons for doing

400
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,400
it the way I'm going
to do is because I

401
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:55,555
want you to get what our word
into your consciousness, two

402
00:24:55,555 --> 00:24:57,220
words, integrating factor.

403
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:02,500
I'm going to solve this equation
by finding and integrating

404
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:09,000
factor of the form U of X.
What's an integrating factor?

405
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Well, I'll show you not by
writing an elaborate definition

406
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,666
on the board, but showing
you what its function is.

407
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:19,332
It's a certain
function, U of X, I

408
00:25:19,332 --> 00:25:23,200
don't know what it is, but
here's what I wanted to do.

409
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,763
I want to multiply, I'm going
to drop the X's a just so

410
00:25:26,763 --> 00:25:29,110
that the thing looks
less complicated.

411
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:34,125
So, what I want to do is
multiply this equation

412
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,000
through by U of X.

413
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,360
That's why it's called
a factor because you're

414
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,816
going to multiply
everything through by it.

415
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:49,220
So, it's going to look like
UY prime plus PUY equals QU,

416
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,776
and now, so far,
it's just a factor.

417
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:55,375
What makes it an
integrating factor

418
00:25:55,375 --> 00:26:00,766
is that this, after I do
that, I want this to turn out

419
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:04,500
to be the derivative of
something with respect

420
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,250
to X. You see the
motivation for that.

421
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,125
If this turns out to be the
derivative of something,

422
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,363
because I've chosen
U so cleverly,

423
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,000
then I will be able to solve
the equation immediately

424
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
just by integrating
this with respect to X,

425
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and integrating that
with respect to X.

426
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,750
You just, then, integrate
both sides with respect to X,

427
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,000
and the equation is solved.

428
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Now, the only question is,
what should I choose for U?

429
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Well, if you think of
the product formula,

430
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
there might be many
things to try here.

431
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But there's only one
reasonable thing to try.

432
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Try to pick U so that it's
the derivative of U times Y.

433
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,665
See how reasonable that is?

434
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:49,333
If I use the product
rule on this,

435
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:52,000
the first term is
U times Y prime.

436
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The second term would
be U prime times Y.

437
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Well, I've got the Y there.

438
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So, this will work.

439
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,888
It works if, what's the
condition that you must satisfy

440
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:09,000
in order for that to be true?

441
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Well, it must be that after
it to the differentiation,

442
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
U prime turns out
to be P times U.

443
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,816
So, is it clear?

444
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:26,625
This is something we want to be
equal to, and the thing I will

445
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:32,331
try to do it is by
choosing U in such a way

446
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:37,000
that this equality
will take place.

447
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And then I will be able
to solve the equation.

448
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And so, here's what my
U prime must satisfy.

449
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,815
Hey, we can solve that.

450
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:47,222
But please don't
forget that P is

451
00:27:47,222 --> 00:27:49,000
P of X. It's a function of X.

452
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So, if you separate variables,
I'm going to do this.

453
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,600
So, what is it, DU over
U equals P of X times DX.

454
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,500
If I integrate that,
so, separate variables,

455
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,665
integrate, and you're going
to get DU over U integrates

456
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:08,428
to the be the log of
U, and the other side

457
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:12,000
integrates to be the
integral of P of X DX.

458
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Now, you can put an
arbitrary constant there,

459
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,448
or you can think of
it as already implied

460
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,142
by the indefinite integral.

461
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:24,500
Well, that doesn't tell
us, yet, what U is.

462
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,000
What should U be?

463
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,250
Notice, I don't have to find
every possible U, which works.

464
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,000
All I'm looking for is one.

465
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
All I want is a single view
which satisfies that equation.

466
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Well, U equals the integral,
E to the integral of PDX.

467
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,500
That's not too
beautiful looking,

468
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,726
but by differential
equations, things

469
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:50,454
can get so complicated
that in a week or two,

470
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:55,000
you will think of this as
an extremely simple formula.

471
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So, there is a formula for
our integrating factor.

472
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,500
We found it.

473
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,250
We will always be able to
write an integrating factor.

474
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:14,750
Don't worry about the arbitrary
constant because you only need

475
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,000
one such U.

476
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So: no arbitrary constant
since only one U needed.

477
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,600
And, that's the
solution, the way

478
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,200
we solve the linear equation.

479
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:37,544
OK, let's take over,
and actually do it.

480
00:29:37,544 --> 00:29:43,714
I think it would be
better to summarize it

481
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:48,000
as a clear cut method.

482
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So, let's do that.

483
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So, what's our method?

484
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's the method for solving
Y prime plus PY equals Q.

485
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,800
Well, the first place, make sure
it's in standard linear form.

486
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,331
If it isn't, you must
put it in that form.

487
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:14,712
Notice, the formula for the
integrating factor, the formula

488
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,856
for the integrating
factor involves

489
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,000
P, the integral of PDX.

490
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So, you'd better
get the right P.

491
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,600
Otherwise, you are sunk.

492
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,750
OK, so put it in
standard linear form.

493
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,332
That way, you will have
the right P. Notice

494
00:30:29,332 --> 00:30:32,544
that if you wrote
it in that form,

495
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:35,375
and all you remembered
was E to the integral PDX,

496
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,000
the P would have the wrong sign.

497
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,070
If you're going to write, that
P should have a negative sign

498
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,570
there.

499
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,500
So, do it this way,
and no other way.

500
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,665
Otherwise, you will get
confused and get wrong signs.

501
00:30:47,665 --> 00:30:51,331
And, as I say, that will
produce wrong answers, and not

502
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:54,000
just slightly wrong
answers, but disastrously

503
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,664
wrong answers from the point
of view of the modeling

504
00:30:57,664 --> 00:31:02,108
if you really want answers
to physical problems.

505
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:06,600
So, here's a
standard linear form.

506
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,666
Then, find the
integrating factor.

507
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:17,000
So, calculate E to the integral,
PDX, the integrating factor,

508
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and that multiply both,
I'm putting this as both,

509
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:31,000
underlined that as many times
as you have room in your notes.

510
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,362
Multiply both sides by this
integrating factor by E

511
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:42,400
to the integral PDX.

512
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,000
And then, integrate.

513
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
OK, let's take a simple example.

514
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,400
Suppose we started with
the equation XY prime

515
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:06,000
minus Y equals, I had X2,
X3, something like that,

516
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
X3, I think, yeah, X2.

517
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
OK, what's the
first thing to do?

518
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,915
Put it in standard form.

519
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:25,915
So, step zero will be to
write it as Y prime minus

520
00:32:25,915 --> 00:32:30,000
one over X times Y equals X2.

521
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,833
Let's do the work first, and
then I'll talk about mistakes.

522
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:39,888
Well, we now calculate
the integrating factor.

523
00:32:39,888 --> 00:32:43,000
So, I would do it in steps.

524
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You can integrate negative
one over X, right?

525
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,500
That integrates to
minus log X. So,

526
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:57,000
the integrating factor is E
to the integral of this, DX.

527
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So, it's E to the
negative log X.

528
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,500
Now, in real life, that's
not the way to leave that.

529
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,333
What is E to the negative log X?

530
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:16,000
Well, think of it as E to
the log X to the minus one.

531
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,570
Or, in other words, it is
E to the log X is X. So,

532
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,000
it's one over X.

533
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So, the integrating
factor is one over X.

534
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
OK, multiply both sides
by the integrating factor.

535
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,500
Both sides of what?

536
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:41,000
Both sides of this: the equation
written in standard form,

537
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,200
and both sides.

538
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,800
So, it's going to be one over
XY prime minus one over X2 Y

539
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,815
is equal to X2 times one over
X, which is simply X. Now,

540
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:55,545
if you have done
the work correctly,

541
00:33:55,545 --> 00:34:01,000
you should be able, now,
to integrate the left hand

542
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,110
side directly.

543
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:06,428
So, I'm going to
write it this way.

544
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:10,815
I always recommend that you
put it as extra step, well,

545
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:14,142
put it as an extra
step the reason

546
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:17,000
for using that
integrating factor,

547
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,200
in other words, that the left
hand side is supposed to be,

548
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,000
now, one over X times Y prime.

549
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,328
I always put it that
because there's always

550
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:31,775
a chance you made a mistake
or forgot something.

551
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:34,555
Look at it, mentally
differentiated

552
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:39,855
using the product rule just
to check that, in fact, it

553
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:43,000
turns out to be the same
as the left hand side.

554
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,535
So, what do we get?

555
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:48,500
One over X times Y prime
plus Y times the derivative

556
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,800
of one over X, which indeed
is negative one over X2.

557
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,000
And now, finally, that's 3A,
continue, do the integration.

558
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,149
So, you're going
to get, let's see

559
00:35:00,149 --> 00:35:04,904
if we can do it all on one
board, one over X times Y

560
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:07,904
is equal to X plus a
constant, X, sorry, X2

561
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,857
over two plus a constant.

562
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:16,332
And, the final step
will be, therefore, now

563
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:21,000
I want to isolate Y by itself.

564
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So, Y will be equal to
multiply through by X.

565
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
X3 over two plus C times X.
And, that's the solution.

566
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
OK, let's do one a little
slightly more complicated.

567
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,816
Let's try this one.

568
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:45,545
Now, my equation
is going to be one,

569
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:51,000
I'll still keep two, Y
and X, as the variables.

570
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'll use T and F
for a minute or two.

571
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,360
One plus cosine X,
so, I'm not going

572
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,000
to give you this one in
standard form either.

573
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,332
It's a trick question.

574
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:17,332
Y prime minus sine X times Y is
equal to anything reasonable,

575
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:19,000
I guess.

576
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I think X, 2X, make
it more exciting.

577
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,920
OK, now, I think
I should warn you

578
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:38,000
where the mistakes are just so
that you can make all of them.

579
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So, this is mistake number one.

580
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,750
You don't put it
in standard form.

581
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:51,000
Mistake number two: generally
people can do step one fine.

582
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Mistake number two is, this
is my most common mistake,

583
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
so I'm very sensitive to it.

584
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,750
But that doesn't
mean if you make it,

585
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,000
you'll get any sympathy from me.

586
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I don't give sympathy to myself.

587
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,400
You are so intense,
so happy at having

588
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,332
found the integrating
factor, you

589
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:16,332
forget to multiply Q by the
integrating factor also.

590
00:37:16,332 --> 00:37:20,332
You just handle the left
hand side of the equation,

591
00:37:20,332 --> 00:37:22,999
if you forget about
the right hand side.

592
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:27,220
So, the emphasis on the
both here is the right hand,

593
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,000
please include the Q.

594
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Please include the
right hand side.

595
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,332
Any other mistakes?

596
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:37,250
Well, nothing that
I can think of.

597
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,664
Well, maybe only,
anyway, we are not

598
00:37:39,664 --> 00:37:43,570
going to make any mistakes
the rest of this lecture.

599
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,000
So, what do we do?

600
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,304
We write this in standard form.

601
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:51,600
So, it's going to look
like Y prime minus sine X,

602
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,816
sine X divided by one
plus cosine X times Y

603
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:59,000
equals, my heart
sinks because I know

604
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I'm supposed to integrate
something like this.

605
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And, boy, that's going
to give me problems.

606
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,713
Well, not yet.

607
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:11,000
With the integrating factor?

608
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The integrating
factor is, well, we

609
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,220
want to calculate the
integral of negative sine X

610
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,000
over one plus cosine.

611
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,875
That's the integral of PDX.

612
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:25,500
And, after that, we
have to exponentiate it.

613
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, can you do this?

614
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah, but if you stare
at it a little while,

615
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,000
you can see that the top is
the derivative of the bottom.

616
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,332
That is great.

617
00:38:39,332 --> 00:38:43,600
That means it integrates
to be the log of one

618
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,362
plus cosine X. Is that
right, one over one

619
00:38:47,362 --> 00:38:51,625
plus cosine X times the
derivative of this, which

620
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:56,375
is negative cosine X. Therefore,
the integrating factor

621
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,875
is E to that.

622
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:02,270
In other words, it
is one plus cosine X.

623
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:05,500
Therefore, so this
was step zero.

624
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,332
Step one, we found the
integrating factor.

625
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:17,000
And now, step two, we multiply
through the integrating factor.

626
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,220
And what do we get?

627
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,142
We multiply through the
standard for equation

628
00:39:23,142 --> 00:39:29,000
by the integrating factor, if
you do that, what you get is,

629
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
well, Y prime gets the
coefficient one plus cosine X,

630
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,885
Y prime minus sign X equals 2X.

631
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:40,000
Oh, dear.

632
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Well, I hope somebody
would giggle at this point.

633
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,270
What's giggle able about it?

634
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:51,000
Well, that all this was
totally wasted work.

635
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,500
It's called spinning
your wheels.

636
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,500
No, it's not
spinning your wheels.

637
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,000
It's doing what
you're supposed to do,

638
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
and finding out that you
wasted the entire time doing

639
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
what you were supposed to do.

640
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,140
Well, in other words,
that net effect of this

641
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,856
is to end up with the same
equation we started with.

642
00:40:16,856 --> 00:40:19,000
But, what is the point?

643
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,178
The point of having
done all this

644
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:26,775
was because now the left
hand side is exactly

645
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:32,270
the derivative of something,
and the left hand side should

646
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,000
be the derivative of what?

647
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,904
Well, it should be
the derivative of one

648
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:40,600
plus cosine X
times Y, all prime.

649
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,776
Now, you can check that
that's in fact the case.

650
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,815
It's one plus cosine X,
Y prime, plus minus sine

651
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:51,856
X, the derivative of
this side times Y.

652
00:40:51,856 --> 00:40:56,220
So, if you had thought, in
looking at the equation,

653
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,724
to say to yourself, this
is a derivative of that,

654
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:04,248
maybe I'll just check
right away to see

655
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:08,571
if it's the derivative of
one plus cosine X sine.

656
00:41:08,571 --> 00:41:12,000
You would have saved that work.

657
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Well, you don't have to
be brilliant or clever,

658
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,332
or anything like that.

659
00:41:17,332 --> 00:41:20,200
You can follow your
nose, and it's just,

660
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,875
I want to give you a positive
experience in solving

661
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:28,000
linear equations,
not too negative.

662
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Anyway, so we got to this point.

663
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So, now this is 2X, and
now we are ready to solve

664
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,500
the equation, which is the
solution now will be one plus

665
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,000
cosine X times Y is equal
to X2 plus a constant,

666
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,524
and so Y is equal to X2 divided
by X2 plus a constant divided

667
00:41:55,524 --> 00:42:01,400
by one plus cosine X. Suppose
I have given you an initial

668
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,000
condition, which I didn't.

669
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But, suppose the initial
condition said that Y of zero

670
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,332
were one, for instance.

671
00:42:08,332 --> 00:42:11,665
Then, the solution would
be, so, this is an if,

672
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:15,498
I'm throwing in at the end just
to make it a little bit more

673
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:17,400
of a problem, how
would I put, then

674
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,400
I could evaluate the constant
by using the initial condition.

675
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,000
What would it be?

676
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,454
This would be, on the
left hand side, one,

677
00:42:25,454 --> 00:42:30,000
on the right hand side
would be C over two.

678
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So, I would get one
equals C over two.

679
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,875
Is that correct?

680
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:42,180
Cosine of zero is one,
so that's two down below.

681
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:48,856
Therefore, C is equal to
two, and that would then

682
00:42:48,856 --> 00:42:51,000
complete the solution.

683
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
We would be X2 plus two
over one plus cosine X.

684
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Now, you can do this
in general, of course,

685
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,180
and get a general formula.

686
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:11,712
And, we will have occasion
to use that next week.

687
00:43:11,712 --> 00:43:15,220
But for now, why
don't we concentrate

688
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,555
on the most interesting
case, namely

689
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:21,885
that of the most
linear equation,

690
00:43:21,885 --> 00:43:24,332
with constant
coefficient, that is,

691
00:43:24,332 --> 00:43:27,714
so let's look at
the linear equation

692
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:31,284
with constant coefficient,
because that's

693
00:43:31,284 --> 00:43:37,000
the one that most closely models
the conduction and diffusion

694
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,666
equations.

695
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:43,000
So, what I'm interested in, is
since this is the, of them all,

696
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,400
probably it's the
most important case

697
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,500
is the one where P
is a constant because

698
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,000
of its application to that.

699
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,500
And, many of the other, the
bank account, for example,

700
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,666
all of those will use
a constant coefficient.

701
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,428
So, how is the
thing going to look?

702
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:01,000
Well, I will use the cooling.

703
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Let's use the temperature
model, for example.

704
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,220
The temperature
model, the equation

705
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,600
will be DTDT plus
KT is equal to.

706
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,800
Now, notice on the right hand
side, this is a common error.

707
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,000
You don't put TE.

708
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
You have to put KTE because
that's what the equation says.

709
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
If you think units, you
won't have any trouble.

710
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Units have to be compatible on
both sides of a differential

711
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,666
equation.

712
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:34,331
And therefore, whatever the
units were for capital KT,

713
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:38,541
I'd have to have the same
units on the right hand side,

714
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:42,664
which indicates I cannot have KT
on the left of the differential

715
00:44:42,664 --> 00:44:44,998
equation, and just
T on the right,

716
00:44:44,998 --> 00:44:47,500
and expect the units
to be compatible.

717
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,000
That's not possible.

718
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,100
So, that's a good
way of remembering

719
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,000
that if you're modeling
temperature or concentration,

720
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
you have to have
the K on both sides.

721
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,080
OK, let's do, now, a lot of this
we are going to do in our head

722
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,000
now because this
is really too easy.

723
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,220
What's the integrating factor?

724
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:13,227
Well, the integrating factor is
going to be the integral of K,

725
00:45:13,227 --> 00:45:16,000
the coefficient now is just K.

726
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,284
P is a constant, K, and if
I integrate KDT, I get KT,

727
00:45:21,284 --> 00:45:23,000
and I exponentiate that.

728
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So, the integrating
factor is E to the KT.

729
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I multiply through both sides,
multiply by E to the KT,

730
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
and what's the
resulting equation?

731
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,333
Well, it's going to be , I'll
write it in the compact form.

732
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:50,000
It's going to be E to the
KT times T, all prime.

733
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,284
The differentiation is now,
of course, with respect

734
00:45:55,284 --> 00:45:57,000
to the time.

735
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,750
And, that's equal
to KTE, whatever

736
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:04,725
that is, times E to the KT.

737
00:46:04,725 --> 00:46:09,000
This is a function
of T, of course,

738
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,500
the function of little
time, sorry, little T time.

739
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,000
OK, and now, finally, we
are going to integrate.

740
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,332
What's the answer?

741
00:46:19,332 --> 00:46:26,224
Well, it is E to the, so, are we
going to get E to the KT times

742
00:46:26,224 --> 00:46:31,750
T is, sorry, K little t, K
times time times the temperature

743
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:37,000
is equal to the integral of KTE.

744
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,840
I'll put the fact that
it's a function of T

745
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,998
inside just to remind
you, E to the KT,

746
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:46,500
and now I'll put the
arbitrary constant.

747
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,142
Let's put in the arbitrary
constant explicitly.

748
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:53,000
So, what will T be?

749
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
OK, T will look
like this, finally.

750
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It will be E to the negative KT.

751
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,500
That's on the outside.

752
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,000
Then, you will integrate.

753
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,552
Of course, the difficulty
of doing this integral

754
00:47:07,552 --> 00:47:12,000
depends entirely upon how this
external temperature varies.

755
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,726
But anyways, it's going to be
K times that function, which

756
00:47:16,726 --> 00:47:20,000
I haven't specified,
E to the KT plus C

757
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,664
times E to the negative KT.

758
00:47:22,664 --> 00:47:27,000
Now, some people, many, in
fact, that almost always,

759
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,750
in the engineering
literature, almost never

760
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:36,285
write indefinite integrals
because an indefinite integral

761
00:47:36,285 --> 00:47:38,000
is indefinite.

762
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,400
In other words, this covers
not just one function,

763
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,800
but a whole multitude
of functions

764
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,000
which differ from each other
by an arbitrary constant.

765
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So, in a formula like this,
there's a certain vagueness,

766
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,541
and it's further
compounded by the fact

767
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:55,000
that I don't know whether the
arbitrary constant is here.

768
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,571
I seem to have put it explicitly
on the outside the way

769
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:02,000
you're used to
doing from calculus.

770
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,570
Many people, therefore,
prefer, and I

771
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,565
think you should
learn this, to do

772
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:11,885
what is done in the very first
section of the notes called

773
00:48:11,885 --> 00:48:13,500
definite integral solutions.

774
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,400
If there's an initial
condition saying

775
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,200
that the internal
temperature at time zero

776
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,912
is some given value,
what they like to do

777
00:48:22,912 --> 00:48:26,248
is make this thing definite
by integrating here

778
00:48:26,248 --> 00:48:30,625
from zero to T, and making
this a dummy variable.

779
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:36,272
You see, what that
does is it gives you

780
00:48:36,272 --> 00:48:39,452
a particular
function, whereas, I'm

781
00:48:39,452 --> 00:48:44,766
sorry I didn't put in
the DT one minus two.

782
00:48:44,766 --> 00:48:49,554
What it does is that
when time is zero,

783
00:48:49,554 --> 00:48:52,662
all this automatically
disappears,

784
00:48:52,662 --> 00:49:00,000
and the arbitrary constant
will then be, it's T.

785
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,125
So, in other words, C
times this, which is one,

786
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:05,000
is that equal to [T?].

787
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
In other words, if
I make this zero,

788
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
that I can write C as equal to
this arbitrary starting value.

789
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Now, when you do this,
the essential thing,

790
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and we're going to come
back to this next week,

791
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
but right away,
because K is positive,

792
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,400
I want to emphasize that so much
at the beginning of the period,

793
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,428
I want to conclude by showing
you what its significance is.

794
00:49:30,428 --> 00:49:35,332
This part disappears
because K is positive.

795
00:49:35,332 --> 00:49:38,000
The conductivity is positive.

796
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
This part disappears
as T goes to zero.

797
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
This goes to zero as
T goes to infinity.

798
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So, this is a
solution that remains.

799
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,625
This, therefore, is called
the steady state solution,

800
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:57,000
the thing which the
temperature behaves like,

801
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
as T goes to infinity.

802
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
This is called the transient.

803
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
because it disappears
as T goes to infinity.

804
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,664
It depends on the
initial condition,

805
00:50:09,664 --> 00:50:12,200
but it disappears,
which shows you,

806
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,665
then, in the long run
for this type of problem

807
00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:20,000
the initial condition
makes no difference.

808
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,550
The function behaves always the
same way as T goes to infinity.
