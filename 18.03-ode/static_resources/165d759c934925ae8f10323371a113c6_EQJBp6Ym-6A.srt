1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I assume from high school you
know how to add and multiply

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
complex numbers using the
relation i squared equals

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
negative one.
I'm a little less certain that

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
you remember how to divide them.
I hope you read last night by

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
way of preparation for that,
but since that's something

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we're going to have to do a lot
of a differential equations,

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so remember that the division
is done by making use of the

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
complex conjugate.
So, if z is equal to a plus bi,

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
some people write a plus ib,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and sometimes I'll do
that too if it's more

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
convenient.
Then, the complex conjugate is

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
what you get by changing i to
negative i.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And, the important thing is
that the product of those two is

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
a real number.
The product of these is a

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
squared minus the quantity ib
all squared,

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
which makes a squared plus b
squared because i

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
squared is negative one.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, the product of those,
that's what you multiply if you

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
want to multiply this by
something to make it real.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You always multiplied by its
complex conjugate.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And that's the trick that
underlines the doing of the

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
division.
So, for example,

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I better hang onto these or
I'll never remember all the

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
examples.
Suppose, for example,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
we wanted to calculate (two
plus i) divided by (one minus 3

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
i).
To calculate it means I want to

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
do the division;
I want to express the answer in

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
the form a plus bi.
What you do is multiply the top

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and bottom by the complex
conjugate of the denominator in

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
order to make it real.
So, it's (one plus 3i) divided

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
by (one plus 3i),
as they taught you in

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
elementary school,
that is one,

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
in a rather odd notation;
therefore, multiplying doesn't

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
change the value of the
fraction.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And so, the denominator now
becomes 1 squared plus 3

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
squared, which is ten.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And, the numerator is,
learn to do this without

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
multiplying out four terms.
You must be able to do this in

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
your head.
And, you always do it by the

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
grouping, or post office method,
whatever you want to call it,

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
namely, first put down the real
part, which is made out of two

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
times one minus three times one.
So, that's negative one.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And then, the imaginary part,
which is i times one.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's one, coefficient one,
plus 6i.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, that makes 7i.
Now, some people feel this

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
still doesn't look right,
if you wish,

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and for some places and
differential equations,

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
it will be useful to write that
as minus one tenth plus seven

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
tenths i.
And, now it's perfectly clear

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that it's in the form a plus bi.
So, learn to do that if you

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
don't know already.
It's going to be important.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Now, the main thing today is
the polar representation,

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
which sometimes they don't get
to in high school.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And if they do,
it's usually not in a grown

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
up-enough in a form for us to be
able to use it.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So, I have to worry about that
little bit.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The polar representation,
of course, is nominally just

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
the switch to polar coordinates.
If here's a plus bi,

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
then this is r,
and that's theta.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And therefore,
this can be written as,

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
in the polar form,
that would be r cosine theta

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
plus i, or r cosine theta.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's the A part.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And, the B part is,
the imaginary part is r

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
sin(theta) times i.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Now, it would be customary,
at this point,

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
to put the i in front,
just because it looks better.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The complex numbers are
commutative, satisfied to

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
commutative law of
multiplication,

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
which means it doesn't matter
in multiplication whether you

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
put i in front or behind.
It's still the same answer.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So, this would be r cosine
theta plus i times

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
r sine theta,

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
which, of course,
will factor out,

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and will make it cosine theta
plus i sine theta.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Now, it was Euler who took the

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
decisive step and said,
hey, look, I'm going to call

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
that e to the i theta.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Now, why did he do that?
Because everything seemed to

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
indicate that it should.
But that's certainly worth the

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
best color we have,
which is what?

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We are getting low here.
Okay, nonetheless,

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
it's worth pink.
I will even give him his due,

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Euler.
Sometimes it's called Euler's

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
formula, but it really shouldn't
be.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's not a formula.
It's a definition.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So, in some sense,
you can't argue with it.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you want to call putting a
complex number in a power,

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and calling it that,
you can.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But, one can certainly ask why
he did it.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And the answer,
I guess, is that all the

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
evidence seemed to point to the
fact that it was the thing to

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
do.
Now, I think it's important to

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
talk about a little bit because
I think it's,

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
in my opinion,
if you're seeing this for the

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
first time, even if you read
about it last night,

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
it's a mysterious thing,
and one needs to see it from

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
every possible point of view.
It's something you get used to.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You will never see it in a
sudden flash of insight.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It will just get as familiar to
you as more common arithmetic,

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and algebraic,
and calculus processes are.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But, look.
What is it we demand?

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If you're going to call
something an exponential,

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
what is it we want an
exponential to do,

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
what gives an expression like
this the right to be called e to

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the i theta?
The answer is I can't creep

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
inside Euler's mind.
It must have been a very big

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
day of his life.
He had a lot of big days,

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
but when he realized that that
was the thing to write down as

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
the definition of e to the i
theta.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But, what is it one wants of an
exponential?

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, the high school answer
surely is you want it to satisfy

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the exponential law.
Now, to my shock,

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I realize a lot of people don't
know.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
In my analysis class,
these are some math majors,

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
or graduate engineers in
various subjects,

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and if I say prove such and
such using the exponential law,

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sure to get at least half a
dozen e-mails asking me,

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
what's the exponential law?
Okay, the exponential law is a

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
to the x times a to the y equals
a to the x plus y:

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
the law of exponents.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's the most important
reason why, that's the single

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
most important thing about
exponents, are the way one uses

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
them.
And, this is the exponential

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
function, called the exponential
function because all this

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
significant stuff is in the
exponents.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
All right, so it should
satisfy-- we want,

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
first of all,
the exponential law to be true.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But that's not all.
That's a high school answer.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
An MIT answer would be,
I mean, why is e to the x such

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
a popular function?
Well, of course,

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
it does satisfy the exponential
law, but for us,

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
an even more reasonable thing.
It's the function,

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
which, when you differentiate
it, you get the same thing you

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
started with.
And, it's apart from a constant

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
factor, the only such function.
Now, in terms of differential

137
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
equations, it means that it's
the solution that e to the,

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
let's be a little generous,
make it e to the ax.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, better not to use x because
complex numbers tend to be

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
called x plus iy.
Let's use t as a more neutral

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
variable, which is standing
outside the fray,

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
as it were.
It satisfies the relationship

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
that it's the solution,
if you like,

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
to the differential equation.
That's a fancy way of saying

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
it.
dy / dt equals a times y.

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Now, of course,

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
that is not unique.
We could make it unique by

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
putting in an initial value.
So, if I want to get this

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
function and not a constant
times it, I should make this an

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
initial value problem and say
that y of zero should be one.

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And now, I will get only the

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
function, e to the at.
So, in other words,

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
that characterizes this
function.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's the only function in the
whole world that has that

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
property.
Now, if you're going to call

156
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
something e to the i theta,
we want that to be true.

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So, here are my questions.
Is it true that e to the i

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
theta one, let's use that,
times e to the i theta two,

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
see, I'm on a collision course

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
here, but that's easily fixed.
Is that equal to e to the i

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
(theta one plus theta two)?

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
If that turns out to be so,
that's a big step.

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What would we like to be true
here?

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, will it be true that the
derivative, with respect to t of

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
e to the i theta,
I would like that to be equal

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
to i times e to the i theta.

167
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So, question,

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
question.
I think those are the two most

169
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
significant things.
Now, the nodes do a third

170
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
thing, talk about infinite
series.

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Since we haven't done infinite
series, anyway,

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
it's not officially part of the
syllabus, the kind of power

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
series that are required.
But, I will put it down for the

174
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
sake of completeness,
as people like to say.

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So, it should behave right.
The infinite series should be

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
nice.
The infinite series should work

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
out.
There is no word for this,

178
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
should work out,
let's say.

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I mean, what's the little
music?

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Is that some weird music idea,
or is it only me that hears it?

181
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
[LAUGHTER] Yes,
Lord.

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I feel I'm being watched up
there.

183
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This is terrible.
So, there's one guy.

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Here's another guy.
And, I won't put a box around

185
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the infinite series,
since I'm not going to say

186
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
anything about it.
Now, these things,

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
in fact, are both true.
Otherwise, why would I be

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
saying them, and why would Euler
have made the formula?

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But, what's interesting to see
is what's behind them.

190
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And, that gives you little
practice also in calculating

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
with the complex numbers.
So, let's look at the first

192
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
one.
What will it say?

193
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It is asking the question.
It says, please,

194
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
calculate the product of these
two things.

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Okay, I do it,
I'm told.

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I will calculate the product of
cosine theta one plus i cosine

197
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
theta two-- Sine.
Sine theta one.

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's e to the i

199
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
theta one, right?

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So, that corresponds to this.
The other factor times the

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
other factor,
cosine theta two plus i sine

202
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
theta two.

203
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay, what does that come out
to be?

204
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, again,
we will use the method of

205
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
grouping.
What's the real part of it?

206
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The real part of it is cosine
theta one cosine theta two.

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And then, there's a real part,

208
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
which comes from these two
factors.

209
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's going to occur with a
minus sign because of the i

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
squared.
And, what's left is sine theta

211
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
one sine theta two.

212
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And then, the imaginary part,
I'll factor out the i.

213
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And then, what's left,
I won't have to keep repeating

214
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
the i.
So, it will have to be sine

215
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
theta one cosine theta two.

216
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And, the other factor will be
cosine theta one sine theta

217
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
two-- plus sine theta two cosine
theta one.

218
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, it looks like a mess,

219
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
but, again, high school to the
rescue.

220
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What is this?
The top thing is nothing in

221
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
disguise, but it's a disguised
form of cosine (theta one plus

222
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
theta two).

223
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And the bottom is sine of
(theta one plus theta two).

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So, the product of these two

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
things is this,
and that's exactly the formula.

226
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
In other words,
this formula is a way of

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
writing those two trigonometric
identities for the cosine of the

228
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
sum and the sine of the sum.
Instead of the two identities

229
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
taking up that much space,
written one after the other,

230
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
they take up as much space,
and they say exactly the same

231
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
thing.
Those two trigonometric

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
identities are exactly the same
as saying that e to the i theta

233
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
satisfies the
exponential law.

234
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Now, people ask,
you know, what's beautiful in

235
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
mathematics?
To me, that's beautiful.

236
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I think that's great.
Something long turns into

237
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
something short,
and it's just as good,

238
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and moreover,
connects with all these other

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
things in the world,
differential equations,

240
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
infinite series,
blah, blah, blah,

241
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
blah, blah.
Okay, I don't have to sell

242
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Euler.
He sells himself.

243
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Now, how about the other one?
How about the other one?

244
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Now, that's obviously,
I haven't said something

245
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
because for one thing,
how do you differentiate if

246
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
there's theta here,
and t down there.

247
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay, that's easily fixed.
But, how do I differentiate

248
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
this?
What kind of a guy is e to the

249
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
i theta?
Well, if I write it out,

250
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
take a look at what it is.
It's cosine theta plus i sine

251
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
theta.

252
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
As theta varies,
it's a function.

253
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The variable is real.
Theta is a real variable.

254
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Its angle in radians,
but it runs from negative

255
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
infinity to infinity.
So, if you think of functions

256
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
as a black box,
what's going in is a real

257
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
number.
But, what's coming out is a

258
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
complex number.
So, schematically,

259
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
here is the e to the i theta
box,

260
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
if you like to think that way,
theta goes in,

261
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and that's real,
and a complex number,

262
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
this particular complex number
goes out.

263
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So, one, we'd call it,
I'm not going to write this

264
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
down because it's sort of
pompous and takes too long.

265
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But, it is a complex valued
function of a real variable.

266
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You got that?
Up to now, we studied real

267
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
functions of real variables.
But now, real valued functions

268
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
of real variables,
those are the kind calculus is

269
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
concerned with.
But now, it's a complex-valued

270
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
function because the variable is
real.

271
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But, the output,
the value of the function is a

272
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
complex number.
Now, in general,

273
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
such a function,
well, maybe a better say,

274
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
complex-valued,
how about complex-valued

275
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
function of a real variable,
let's change the name of the

276
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
variable.
t is always a real variable.

277
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't think we have complex
time yet, although I'm sure

278
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
there will be someday.
But, the next Einstein appears.

279
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
A complex-valued function of a
real variable,

280
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
t, in general,
would look like this.

281
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
t goes in, and what comes out?
Well: a complex number,

282
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
which I would then have to
write this way.

283
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
In other words,
the real part depends on t,

284
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and the imaginary part depends
upon t.

285
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So, a general function looks
like this, a general

286
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
complex-valued function.
This is just a special case of

287
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
it, where the variable has a
different name.

288
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But, the first function would
be cosine t, and the second

289
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
function would be sine t.
So, my only question is,

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
how do you differentiate such a
thing?

291
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, I'm not going to fuss
over this.

292
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The general definition is,
with deltas and whatnot,

293
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
but the end result of a
perfectly fine definition is,

294
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
you differentiate it by
differentiating each component.

295
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The reason you don't have to
work so very hard is because

296
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
this is a real variable,
and I already know what it

297
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
means to differentiate a
function of a real variable.

298
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So, I could write it this way,
that the derivative of u plus

299
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
iv, I'll abbreviate it that way,
this means the derivative,

300
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
with respect to whatever
variable, since I didn't tell

301
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
you what the variable in these
functions were,

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
well, I don't have to tell you
what I'm differentiating with

303
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
respect to.
It's whatever was there because

304
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
you can't see.
And the answer is,

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
it would be the derivative of u
plus i times the derivative of

306
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
v.
You differentiate it just the

307
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
way you would if these were the
components of a motion vector.

308
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You would get the velocity by
differentiating each component

309
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
separately.
And, that's what you're doing

310
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
here.
Okay, now, the importance of

311
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
that is that it at least tells
me what it is I have to check

312
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
when I check this formula.
So, let's do it now that we

313
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
know what this is.
We know how to differentiate

314
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
the function.
Let's actually differentiate

315
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
it.
That's fortunately,

316
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
by far, the easiest part of the
whole process.

317
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So, let's do it.
So, what's the derivative?

318
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Let's go back to t,
our generic variable.

319
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I want to emphasize that these
functions, when we write them as

320
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
functions, that theta will
almost never be the variable

321
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
outside of these notes on
complex numbers.

322
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It will normally be time or
something like that,

323
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
or x, a neutral variable like
x.

324
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So, what's the derivative of e
to the i theta?

325
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm hoping that it will turn
out to be i e to the i theta,

326
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and that the yellow law may be

327
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
true just as the green one was.
Okay, let's calculate it.

328
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's the derivative,
with respect to,

329
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
unfortunately I can convert t's
to thetas, but not thetas to

330
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
t's.
C'est la vie,

331
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
okay.
Times cosine t plus i sine t,

332
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and what's that?

333
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Well, the derivative of cosine
t, differentiating the real and

334
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
imaginary parts separately,
and adding them up.

335
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's negative sine t,
plus i times cosine t.

336
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Now, let's factor out at the i,

337
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
because it says if I factor out
the i, what do I get?

338
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Well, now, the real part of
what's left would be cosine t.

339
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And, how about the imaginary
part?

340
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Do you see, it will be i sine t
because i times i

341
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
gives me that negative one.

342
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And, what's that?
e to the it.

343
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
i times e to the i t.

344
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So, that works too.
What about the initial

345
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
condition?
No problem.

346
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What is y of zero?
What's the function at zero?

347
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Well, don't say right away,
i times zero is zero,

348
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
so it must be one.
That's illegal because,

349
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
why is that illegal?
It's because in that formula,

350
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
you are not multiplying i times
theta.

351
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I mean, sort of,
you are, but that formula is

352
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
the meaning of e to
the i theta.

353
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Now, it would be very nice if
this is like,

354
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
well, anyway,
you can't do that.

355
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So, you have to do it by saying
it's the cosine of zero plus i

356
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
times the sine of zero.

357
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And, how much is that?
The sine of zero is zero.

358
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Now, it's okay to say i times
zero is zero because that's the

359
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
way complex numbers multiply.
What is the cosine of zero?

360
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's one.
So, the answer,

361
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
indeed, turns out to be one.
So, this checks,

362
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
really, from every conceivable
standpoint down as I indicated,

363
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
also from the standpoint of
infinite series.

364
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So, we are definitely allowed
to use this.

365
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Now, the more general
exponential law is true.

366
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm not going to say much about
it.

367
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So, in other words,
e to the a, this is really a

368
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
definition.
e to the (a plus ib)

369
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
is going to be,
in order for the general

370
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
exponential law to be true,
this is really a definition.

371
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's e to the a times e to the
ib.

372
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Now, notice when I look at
the-- at any complex number,

373
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
--
-- so, in terms of this,

374
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
the polar form of a complex
number, to draw the little

375
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
picture again,
if here is our complex number,

376
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and here is r,
and here is the angle theta,

377
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
so the nice way to write this
complex number is r e to the i

378
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
theta.
The e to the i theta

379
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
is, now, why is that?

380
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What is the magnitude of this?
This is r.

381
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The length of the absolute
value, I didn't talk about

382
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
magnitude in argument.
I guess I should have.

383
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But, it's in the notes.
So, r is called the modulus.

384
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Well, the fancy word is the
modulus.

385
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And, we haven't given the
complex number a name.

386
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Let's call it alpha,
modulus of alpha,

387
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
and theta is called,
it's the angle.

388
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's called the argument.
I didn't make up these words.

389
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
There, from a tradition of
English that has long since

390
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
vanished, when I was a kid,
and you wanted to know what a

391
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
play was about,
you looked in the playbill,

392
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and it said the argument of the
play, it's that old-fashioned

393
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
use of the word argument.
Argument means the angle,

394
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and sometimes that's
abbreviated by arg alpha.

395
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And, this is abbreviated,

396
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
of course, as absolute value of
alpha, its length.

397
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Okay, the notes give you a
little practice changing things

398
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
to a polar form.
I think we will skip that in

399
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
favor of doing a couple of other
things because that's pretty

400
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
easy.
But let me, you should at least

401
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
realize when you should look at
polar form.

402
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The great advantage of polar
form is, particularly once

403
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
you've mastered the exponential
law, the great advantage of

404
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
polar form is it's good for
multiplication.

405
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Now, of course,
you know how to multiply

406
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
complex numbers,
even when they are in the

407
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Cartesian form.
That's the first thing you

408
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
learn in high school,
how to multiply a plus bi times

409
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
c plus di.
But, as you will see,

410
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
when push comes to shove,
you will see this very clearly

411
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
on Friday when we talk about
trigonometric inputs to

412
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
differential equations,
--

413
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
-- that the changing to complex
numbers makes all sorts of

414
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
things easy to calculate,
and the answers come out

415
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
extremely clear,
whereas if we had to do it any

416
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
other way, it's a lot more work.
And worst of all,

417
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
when you finally slog through
to the end, you fear you are

418
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
none the wiser.
It's good for multiplication

419
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
because the product,
so here's any number in its

420
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
polar form.
That's a general complex

421
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
number.
It's modulus times e to the i

422
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
theta times r two e to the i
theta two--

423
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Well,
you just multiply them as

424
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
ordinary numbers.
So, the part out front will be

425
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
r1 r2, and the e to the i theta
parts gets

426
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
multiplied by the exponential
law and becomes e to the i

427
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
(theta one plus theta two) --

428
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
-- which makes very clear that
the multiply geometrically two

429
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
complex numbers,
you multiply the moduli,

430
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
the r's, the absolute values,
how long the arrow is from zero

431
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
to the complex number,
multiply the moduli,

432
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and add the arguments.
So the new number,

433
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
its modulus is the product of
r1 and r2.

434
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And, its argument,
its angle, polar angle,

435
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
is the sum of the old two
angles.

436
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And, you add the angles.
And, you put down in your books

437
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
angles, but I'm being
photographed,

438
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
so I'm going to write
arguments.

439
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
In other words,
it makes the geometric content

440
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
of multiplication clear,
in a sense in which this is

441
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
extremely unclear.
From this law,

442
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, whatever it turns

443
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
out to be, you have not the
slightest intuition that this is

444
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
true about the complex numbers.
That first thing is just a

445
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
formula, whereas this thing is
insightful representation of

446
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
complex multiplication.
Now, I'd like to use it for

447
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
something, but before we do
that, let me just indicate how

448
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
just the exponential notation
enables you to do things in

449
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
calculus, formulas that are
impossible to remember from

450
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
calculus.
It makes them very easy to

451
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
derive.
A typical example of that is,

452
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
suppose you want to,
for example,

453
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
integrate (e to the negative x)
cosine x.

454
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Well, number one,
you spend a few minutes running

455
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
through a calculus textbook and
try to find out the answer

456
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
because you know you are not
going to remember how to do it.

457
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Or, you run to a computer,
and type in Matlab and

458
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
something.
Or, you fish out your little

459
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
pocket calculator,
which will give you a formula,

460
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and so on.
So, you have aides for doing

461
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
that.
But, the way to do it if you're

462
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
on a desert island,
and the way I always do it

463
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
because I never have any of
these little aides around,

464
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and I cannot trust my memory,
probably a certain number of

465
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
you remember how you did it at
high school, or how you did it

466
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
in 18.01, if you took it here.
You have to use integration by

467
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
parts.
But, it's one of the tricky

468
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
things that's not required on an
exam because you had to use

469
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
integration by parts twice in
the same direction,

470
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and then suddenly by comparing
the end product with the initial

471
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
product and writing an equation.
Somehow, the value falls out.

472
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Well, that's tricky.
And it's not the sort of thing

473
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
you can waste time stuffing into
your head, unless you are going

474
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
to be the integration bee during
IAP or something like that.

475
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Instead, using complex numbers
is the way to do this.

476
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
How do I think of this,
cosine x?

477
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
What I do, is I think of that e
to the negative x cosine x

478
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
is the real
part, the real part of what?

479
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Well, cosine x is the real part
of e to the ix.

480
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So, this thing,
this is real.

481
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
This is real,
too.

482
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But I'm thinking of it as the
real part of e to the ix.

483
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Now, if I multiply these two

484
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
together, this is going to turn
out to be, therefore,

485
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
the real part of e to the minus
x.

486
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'll write it out very
pompously, and then I will fix

487
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
it.
I would never write this,

488
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
you are you.
Okay, it's e to the minus x

489
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
times, when I write cosine x
plus i sine x,

490
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
so it is the real part of that
is cosine x.

491
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So, it's the real part of,
write it this way for real part

492
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
of e to the, factor out the x,
and what's up there is

493
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
(negative one plus i) times x.

494
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Okay, and now,
so, the idea is the same thing

495
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
is going to be true for the
integral.

496
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
This is going to be the real
part of that,

497
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
the integral of e to the (minus
one plus i) times x dx.

498
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
In other words,

499
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
what you do is,
this procedure is called

500
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
complexifying the integral.
Instead of looking at the

501
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
original real problem,
I'm going to turn it into a

502
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
complex problem by turning this
thing into a complex

503
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
exponential.
This is the real part of that

504
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
complex exponential.
Now, what's the advantage of

505
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
doing that?
Simple.

506
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's because nothing is easier
to integrate than an

507
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
exponential.
And, though you may have some

508
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
doubts as to whether the
familiar laws work also with

509
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
complex exponentials,
I assure you they all do.

510
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It would be lovely to sit and
prove them.

511
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
On the other hand,
I think after a while,

512
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
you find it rather dull.
So, I'm going to do the fun

513
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
things, and assume that they are
true because they are.

514
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So, what's the integral of e to
the (minus one plus i) x dx?

515
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Well, if there is justice in
heaven, it must be e to the

516
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
(minus one plus i) times x
divided by minus one plus i.

517
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
In some sense,

518
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
that's the answer.
This does, in fact,

519
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
give that.
That's correct.

520
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I want the real part of this.
I want the real part because

521
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
that's the way the original
problem was stated.

522
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I want the real part only.
So, I want the real part of

523
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
this.
Now, this is what separates the

524
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
girls from the women.
[LAUGHTER] This is why you have

525
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
to know how to divide complex
numbers.

526
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So, watch how I find the real
part.

527
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I write it this way.
Normally when I do the

528
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
calculations for myself,
I would skip a couple of these

529
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
steps.
But this time,

530
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I will write everything out.
You're going to have to do this

531
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
a lot in this course,
by the way, both over the

532
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
course of the next few weeks,
and especially towards the end

533
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
of the term where we get into a
complex systems,

534
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
which involve complex numbers.
There's a lot of this.

535
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So, now is the time to learn to
do it, and to feel skillful at

536
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
it.
So, it's this times e to the

537
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
negative x times e to the ix,

538
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
which is cosine x plus
i sine x.

539
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Now, I'm not ready,
yet, to do the calculation to

540
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
find the real part because I
don't like the way this looks.

541
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I want to go back to the thing
I did right at the very

542
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
beginning of the hour,
and turn it into an a plus bi

543
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
type of complex
number.

544
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
In other words,
what we have to do is the

545
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,000
division.
So, the division is going to

546
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
be, now, I'm going to ask you to
do it in your head.

547
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I multiply the top and bottom
by negative one minus I.

548
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
What does that put in the
denominator?

549
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
One squared plus one squared:
Two.

550
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And in the numerator,
negative one minus i.

551
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
This is the same as that.

552
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But now, it looks at the form a
+ bi.

553
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It's negative one over two
minus i times one half.

554
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So, this is multiplied by e to

555
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
the minus x and cosine x.

556
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So, if you are doing it,
and practice a little bit,

557
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
please don't put in all these
steps.

558
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Go from here;
well, I would go from here to

559
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
here by myself.
Maybe you shouldn't.

560
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Practice a little before you do
that.

561
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And now, what do we do with
this?

562
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Now, this is in a form to pick
out the real part.

563
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
We want the real part of this.
So, you don't have to write the

564
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
whole thing out as a complex
number.

565
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
In other words,
you don't have to do all the

566
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
multiplications.
You only have to find the real

567
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
part of it, which is what?
Well, e to the negative x

568
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
will be simply a factor.

569
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
That's a real factor,
which I don't have to worry

570
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
about.
And, in that category,

571
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I can include the two also.
So, I only have to pick out the

572
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
real part of this times that.
And, what's that?

573
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It's negative cosine x.

574
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And, the other real part comes
from the product of these two

575
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
things.
I times negative i is one.

576
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And, what's left is sine x.

577
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So, that's the answer to the

578
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
question.
That's the integral of e to the

579
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
negative x * cosine x.

580
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Notice, it's a completely
straightforward process.

581
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It doesn't involve any tricks,
unless you call going to the

582
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
complex domain a trick.
But, I don't.

583
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
As soon as you see in this
course the combination of e to

584
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
ax times cosine bx or sine bx,

585
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
you should immediately think,

586
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and you're going to get plenty
of it in the couple of weeks

587
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
after the exam,
you are going to get plenty of

588
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
it, and you should immediately
think of passing to the complex

589
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
domain.
That will be the standard way

590
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
we solve such problems.
So, you're going to get lots of

591
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
practice doing this.
But, this was the first time.

592
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Now, I guess in the time
remaining, I'm not going to talk

593
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
about in the notes,
i, R, at all,

594
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
but I would like to talk a
little bit about the extraction

595
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
of the complex roots,
since you have a problem about

596
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
that and because it's another
beautiful application of this

597
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
polar way of writing complex
numbers.

598
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Suppose I want to calculate.
So, the basic problem is to

599
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
calculate the nth roots of one.
Now, in the real domain,

600
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
of course, the answer is,
sometimes there's only one of

601
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
these, one itself,
and sometimes there are two,

602
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
depending on whether n is an
even number or an odd number.

603
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
But, in the complex domain,
there are always n answers as

604
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
complex numbers.
One always has n nth roots.

605
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Now, where are they?
Well, geometrically,

606
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
it's easy to see where they
are.

607
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Here's the unit circle.
Here's the unit circle.

608
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
One of the roots is right here
at one.

609
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Now, where are the others?
Well, do you see that if I

610
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,000
place, let's take n equal five
because that's a nice,

611
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
dramatic number.
If I place these peptides

612
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
equally spaced points around the
unit circle, so,

613
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
in other words,
this angle is alpha.

614
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Alpha should be the angle.
What would be the expression

615
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
for that?
If there were five such equally

616
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
spaced, it would be one fifth of
all the way around the circle.

617
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
All the way around the circle
is two pi.

618
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So, it will be one fifth of two
pi in radians.

619
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Now, it's geometrically clear
that those are the five fifth

620
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
roots because,
how do I multiply complex

621
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
numbers?
I multiply the moduli.

622
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Well, they all have moduli one.
So, if I take this guy,

623
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
let's call that complex number,
oh, I hate to give you,

624
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
they are always giving you
Greek notation.

625
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
All right, why not torture you?
Zeta.

626
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
At least you will learn how to
make a zeta in this period,

627
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
small zeta, so that's zeta.
There's our fifth root of

628
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
unity.
It's the first one that occurs

629
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
on the circle that isn't the
trivial one, one.

630
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Now, do you see that,
how would I calculate zeta to

631
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
the fifth?
Well, if I write zeta in polar

632
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
notation, what would it be?
The modulus would be one,

633
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
and therefore it will be
simply, the r will be one

634
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
for it because its length is
one.

635
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Its modulus is one.
What's up here?

636
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I times that angle,
and that angle is two pi over

637
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
five. So, there's just,

638
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
geometrically I see where zeta
is.

639
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And, if I translate that
geometry into the e to the i

640
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
theta form for
the formula, I see that it must

641
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
be that number.
Now, let's say somebody gives

642
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
you that number and says,
hey, is this the fifth root of

643
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
one?
I forbid you to draw any

644
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
pictures.
What would you do?

645
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You say, well,
I'll raise it to the fifth

646
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,000
power.
What's zeta to the fifth power?

647
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Well, it's e to the i two pi /
five,

648
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and now, if I think of raising
that to the fifth power,

649
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
by the exponential law,
that's the same thing as

650
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
putting a five in front of the
exponent.

651
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So, this times five,
and what's that?

652
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
That's e to the i times two pi.

653
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And, what is that?
Well, it's the angle.

654
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
If the angle is two pi,
I've gone all the way around

655
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
the circle and come back here
again.

656
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I've got the number one.
So, this is one.

657
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Since the argument,
two pi, is the same as an

658
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,000
angle, it's the same as,
well, let's not write it that

659
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
way. It's wrong.

660
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
It's just wrong since two pi
and zero are the same angle.

661
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So, I could replace this by
zero.

662
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Oh dear.
Well, I guess I have to stop

663
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
right in the middle of things.
So, you're going to have to

664
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
read a little bit about how to
find roots in order to do that

665
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
problem.
And, we will go on from that

666
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
point Friday.
