  "content":"Ordinary Differential Equations Manipulatives (\u0026ldquo;Mathlets\u0026rdquo;)\nThis course employs a carefully developed set of dynamic computer applets called \u0026ldquo;Mathlets.\u0026rdquo; They are used in lecture occasionally. Each problem set contains a problem based around one or another of them. (PDF)\nThe Mathlets Gallery can be found on the MIT Interactive Mathematics Site. Each Mathlet has an associated \u0026ldquo;Help\u0026rdquo; file which will open in a new window and provide user instructions.\nFunding for the development of the Mathlets was provided by a grant from the The d\u0026rsquo;Arbeloff Fund for Excellence in MIT Education as part of The d\u0026rsquo;Arbeloff Interactive Mathematics Project (d\u0026rsquo;A I M P).\nWatch a video about the story behind the development of the Mathlets.\n"}
